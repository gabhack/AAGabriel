The multifunctional C terminus of the hematopoietic AML1 transcription factor interacts with coregulatory proteins supports the convergence and integration of physiological signals, and contains the nuclear matrix targeting signal, the protein motif that is necessary and sufficient to target AML1 to subnuclear sites.

To determine the functional domains of Runx1 important for thymocyte development, we cultured Runx1-deficient murine fetal liver (FL) cells on OP9-Delta-like 1 murine stromal cells, which express Delta-like 1 and support thymocyte development in vitro, and introduced Runx1 or C-terminal-deletion mutants of Runx1 into the FL cells by retrovirus infection.

These observations clearly demonstrate that Runx1 functions early in hematopoietic development, and they support the interpretation that the primitive erythroid lineage is established early by a subset of BL-CFCs that develop in a Runx1-independent fashion.

Interestingly, one patient without + 21 showed amplification of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 q supporting the contention that AML1 amplification may be an important additional genetic event.

The oncogenic fusion protein AML1-ETO retains the ability of AML1 to interact with the enhancer core DNA sequences, but blocks AML1-dependent transcription.

While normal Runx1fl/fl lymphoid cells permit mono-allelic deletion, primary Eµ-Myc lymphomas showed selection for retention of both alleles and attempts to enforce deletion in vivo led to compensatory expansion of p53null blasts retaining Runx1.

RUNX1-4A, carrying four mutations at S276, S293, T300, and S303, showed impaired T-cell differentiation activity, but retained the ability to rescue the defective early hematopoiesis of Runx1-deficient cells.

We previously reported that the AML1 molecules with trans-activation subdomains retained can rescue in vitro hematopoietic defects of AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells when expressed by using a knock-in approach.

In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1.

The N-terminal portion of AML1, which is retained in AML1/ETO, contains a region of homology to the FAST proteins, which cooperate with Smads to regulate transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) target genes.

When TEL/AML1 and AML1 proteins are present in cells at the same time, the TEL/AML1 protein inhibits the transactivation activities of AML1 protein on the human CR1 promoter even though TEL/AML1 retains the transactivation domain of AML1.

Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity.

Here we show that endogenous Runx1 and Foxp3 physically interact in normal mammary cells and this interaction blocks Runx1 transcriptional activity.

Mechanistically, RUNX1 interacts with the RUNX1 binding DNA sequence located in SOS1 promoter and positively regulates it.

RUNX1-IT1 contributed to the progression of PC by interacting with the adjacent gene RUNX1.

Since AML1 is a well-defined DNA-binding protein, AML1-ETO fusion proteins have been recognized as DNA-binding proteins interacting with the same consensus DNA-binding site as AML1.

The results demonstrated that Runx1 and HIF-1alpha proteins directly interacted with each other to a degree, in which Runt homology domain of Runx1 was mainly involved.

Leukemia-related abnormal Runx1 fusion protein AML1-ETO, which fuses the N-terminal 177 amino acid residues of the Runx1 protein in frame to ETO (eight-twenty-one) protein, also interacted with HIF-1alpha protein with greater ability than Runx1 itself.

Here, we demonstrate that AML1/Evi-1 interacts with CtBP in SKH1 cells, a leukemic cell line which endogenously overexpresses AML1/Evi-1 and that AML1/Evi-1 requires the interaction with CtBP to repress AML1-induced transactivation.

MEF (for myeloid ELF-1-like factor) is a recently cloned ETS family member that, like AML1B, can strongly transactivate several of these promoters, which led us to examine whether MEF functionally or physically interacts with AML1 proteins.

These findings highlight the role of EZH1 in non-histone lysine methylation, indicating that cooperation between AML1-ETO and EZH1 and AML1-ETO site-specific lysine methylation promote AML1-ETO transcriptional repression in leukemia.

RUNX1-ETO is thought to promote leukemia development through the aberrant regulation of RUNX1 (AML1) target genes.

Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation.

RNF38-induced RUNX1 ubiquitination did not promote RUNX1 degradation, but rather stabilized RUNX1 protein.

The hormonally regulated expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 in granulosa cells, their involvement in progesterone production, and promoted granulosa cell proliferation suggest important roles of RUNX1 and RUNX2 in follicular development and luteinization.

Since we found that high expression of RUNX1 is correlated with poor survival in patients with OC through bioinformatic analysis of TCGA database, we developed RUNX1-knockout clones by CRISPR/Cas9 technique and discovered that RUNX1 depletion could promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OC cells, which was further confirmed by RUNX1 knockdown and overexpression.

Collectively, we revealed that Runx1 signals chondrocyte to osteoblast lineage commitment and promotes endochondral bone formation through enhancing both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes expressions, indicating Runx1 may be a therapeutic target to enhance endochondral bone formation and prevent osteoporosis fractures.

Although full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia.

Isoform AML1/ETO9a was correlated to AML/M2, and it may promote the development of leukemia in combination with the AML1/ETO fusion gene.

In vitro, AML1b promoted differentiation while AML1a promoted proliferation of progenitors capable of short-term lymphomyeloid engraftment.

AML1-ETO is an oncoprotein that can promote self-renewal of primary hematopoietic cells by opposing the activity of AML1.

Most prominently we identified the commonly mutated IKZF1 and RUNX1 involved in the formation of ETV6-AML1 fusion protein, among the interaction partners.

Collectively, our study shows that AML1 gene overexpression characterizes a broader range of leukemic subtypes than previously thought, including various maturation stages of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cytogenetic types additional to those involving the AML1 gene.

Mechanistically, a delicate RUNX1/A-E balance involving competition for common genomic sites that regulate RUNX1/A-E targets sustains the malignant cell phenotype.

Although Runx1 has been shown to be involved in BMP4 signaling in non-neural tissues, the Runx1 function in BMP4-dependent regulation of neuronal development is unclear.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 regulate each other, and we propose that a double negative loop involving MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 may contribute to ETV6/RUNX1-driven arrest of differentiation in pre-B ALL.

To facilitate crystallization, a Runx1 residue involved in a hydrophobic patch that was predicted to be engaged in crystal packing based on the previously reported structures of Runx1-containing crystals was mutated.

We also provide evidence that the regulation of RUNX1 by p38α probably involves the kinase MSK1, which phosphorylates histone H3 at the RUNX1 promoter.

The Runx1 DNA contact map identifies connections with multiple novel and known haematopoietic enhancers that are likely to be involved in regulating Runx1 expression in haematopoietic progenitor cells.

The Runx1-persistent group is involved in transmitting mechanical and thermal information, whereas the Runx1-transient group transmits pruriceptive information.

Furthermore, RUNX1-IT1 enhanced the transcription of the RUNX1 gene, indicating its potential as a cis-regulatory RNA involved in the upstream regulation of RUNX1.

In summary, we propose that high levels of Runx1 in resting CD4+ T cells functions negatively in the regulation of IL-2 transcription, and that TCR activation-mediated down-regulation of Runx1 involves negative auto-regulation of the distal Runx1 promoter and contributes to IL-2 production.

Interphase and metaphase fluorescent in situ hybridization have revealed a RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion signal on derivative chromosome 8 but not on chromosome 21, confirming the unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 8 q22 and 21 q22 involving both the RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 genes.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an AML1-ETO translocation dual probe, showed that the 21 q22 breakpoint involved AML1 locus.

The transcription factor RUNX1 (AML-1, PEBP2alphaB and CBFA2) is essential for definitive haematopoiesis, and chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are frequently found in acute leukaemias.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization performed using the probes TEL/AML1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) showed no fusion involving the TEL and AML1 genes and only a single IGH signal in 20 % of the interphase cells analyzed.

Numerous studies have shown that AML1 plays a vital role in the regulation of expression of many genes involved in hematopoietic cell development, and the impairment of AML1 function disregulates the pathways leading to cellular proliferation and differentiation.

One key mechanism for over-expression seems to be the extra copies of AML1, but other mechanisms may involve an alteration of the activity of the AML1 promoter.

A search for RUNX1 sequences that may be involved in the high frequency of chromosomal translocations revealed that a 555 bp long segment originating in chromosome 11 FLI1 gene was transposed into RUNX1 intron 4.1.

In the remaining mutated cases, with acquired trisomy 21, a missense mutation of AML1, which involved 2 of the 3 copies of the AML1 gene, was found.

AML1 mutations, in MoAML involved both alleles and probably lead to nonfunctional AML1 protein.

AML1 plays a critical role during hematopoiesis and chromosomal translocations involving AML1 are commonly associated with different forms of leukemia, including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Three of eight cases found to be rearranged by Southern hybridization but lacking the characteristic phenotype failed to show evidence of the TEL-AML1 rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that at least some of the discordant cases may involve partner genes other than AML1 in the TEL rearrangement.

Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the AML1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving AML1 gene and chromosome 16.

In previous studies, we have shown that the intracellular expression of peptides containing the NHR2 domain inhibits RUNX1/ETO oligomerization, thereby preventing cell proliferation and inducing differentiation of RUNX1/ETO transformed cells.

The expression level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 in bone marrow of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML (non-M3) was detected by real-time fluorescent Q-PCR, the expression level of lymphoid antigens was detected by flow cytometry, and the relationship of the initially induced remission rate (CR1) with the overall survival (OS) rate was analyzed, the CR1 and OS differences also were analyzed between CD56+ and CD56- patients as well as CD19+ and CD17- patients in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 positive patients with AML.

Although the three RUNX1 isoforms a, b, and c were induced in CD45+ hematopoietic cells, RUNX1c was the only isoform induced in hematoendothelial progenitors (HEPs)/hemogenic endothelium.

This long-term androgen-induced loss of Ezh2 actions ultimately results in sustained reduction of the H3K27me3-repressive mark in the promoter region of the Runt-related transcription factor-1 (Runx1) gene, a luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced transcription factor essential for ovulation, leading to increased Runx1 mRNA expression.

Permethrin also induced ETV6-RUNX1 and IGH-BCL2 fusions in K562 cells, and malathion induced KMT2A-AFF1 and ETV6-RUNX1 fusions.

Furthermore, RUNX1 could be induced by LRG1 in a concentration-dependent manner, while the knockdown of RUNX1 blocked the promotion of the proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis induced by LRG1.

Mechanistically, our study showed that Hoxaas3 regulated lung fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-450b-5p: Hoxaas3 decreased the expression of miR-450b-5p to stimulate level and activity of Runx1 and induced fibrotic LF, whereas Runx1 inhibition alleviated the pro-fibrotic effect of Hoxaas3.

Knockdown or inhibition of RUNX1 induced more apoptosis of AML expressing mtRUNX1 versus wild-type RUNX1 and improved survival of mice engrafted with mtRUNX1-expressing AML.

Consistent with these data, disruption of endogenous RUNX1b around Met-1 using CRISPR/Cas9 induced selective expression of RUNX1ΔΝ24 in several leukemia cell lines.

AML1b-expressing cells form macroscopic colonies in soft agar and induce tumors in nude mice, indicating that AML1 can be a transforming gene when overexpressed in fibroblasts.

However, it is not clear whether or not abnormal expression of Runx1 will induce leukemia and how the change of Runx1 expression level could affect BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis.

Further, we show that AML1-MTG16 can induce epigenetic repressive changes at the histone and DNA level of the AML1 target gene Csf1r (c-fms), encoding the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.

An autocrine mechanism involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) might participate in AML1-ETO mediated JNK-signaling, because AML1-ETO induces G-CSF and G-CSF-R expression, and G-CSF-R-neutralizing antibodies reduce AML1-ETO-induced JNK phosphorylation.

His fusion gene Aml1/Eto remained positive, so he was administered with DLI combined with interferon-a (IFN-a).

The intact SOX-LZ could form homodimers through the leucine zipper, which resulted in inhibition of DNA binding by the HMG box, while SOX-LZ (D105-356), which was incapable of dimerization, showed specific binding with the AACAAT sequence.

Thus, the repressed transactivation of the intact SOX-LZ in CHO cells was primarily attributable to the low level of DNA binding of SOX-LZ homodimers.

The transcription factor Runx1 is required for EHT, but for how long and which endothelial cells are competent to respond to Runx1 are not known.

We further show that while early embryonic Runx1 activity is required for the formation of NPPB+ cells, at later stages Runx1 switches to a genetic repressor and thus its downregulation becomes a prerequisite for the proper development of these pruriceptors.

For instance, although it has been reported that Runx1 is required for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic cell transition (EHT) but not thereafter, recent studies clearly demonstrated that Runx1 is also needed during the period subsequent to EHT, namely at perinatal stage.

The past two decades of research have taught us three important lessons: 1) patients with FPD/AML display atypical symptoms and they have a widened clinical spectrum of FPD, such as eczema and syndromic thrombocytopenia, 2) the elucidation of variant of uncertain significance (VUS) of RUNX1 have revealed their role in epigenetic functions and involvement in the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, and 3) non-coding mutations of RUNX1 also causes FPD/AML.

Recently, there have been important advances in defining the role of CBFβ-SMMHC and its binding partners, the transcription factor RUNX1 and the histone deacetylase HDAC8.

The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16) (p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML.

Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1.

First, depletion of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice led to the induction of significant hydrosalpinx by Chlamydia, indicating that CD8+ T cells are necessary to inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity.

Thus, our data suggest an E8(I)-and Runx3/CBFβ-dependent epigenetic programming of the Cd8a locus during T-cell activation leading to Runx/CBFβ complex-independent maintenance of CD8α expression in effector T cells.

Deletion of specific Cd8 enhancers leads to variegated expression of CD8alphabeta heterodimers in double-positive thymocytes.

Despite having better overall survival, animals lacking functional CD8+ T-cells had delayed removal of necrotic tissue leading to poor scar formation and increased cardiac rupture, suggesting that CD8+ T-cells play a dual role in the cardiac remodeling process.

We have also found, however, that while some variant peptides are effective at eliciting both primary and recall CD8+ T cell responses that can recognize the parental epitope, other variant epitopes lead to the outgrowth of CD8+ T cells that only recognize the variant.

Additionally, our data reveal that CD81 inhibits Rac/STAT-1 activation leading to a negative regulation of the production of TNF-α and NO by inflammatory DCs and the activation of cytotoxic T cells by splenic CD8α(+) DCs.

We found that the lack of FcRγ on NK cells limits their ability to restrain virus-specific CD8+ T cells and that the lack of FcRγ in Fcer1g-/- mice leads to enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses and rapid control of the chronic docile strain of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).

PLX51107 delayed melanoma tumor growth and increased activated, proliferating, and functional CD8+ T cells in tumors leading to CD8+ T-cell-mediated tumor growth delay.

Antigen associated with lysed cells is cross-presented by CD8α+ dendritic cells leading to activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

Treatment of MCMV-infected mice with MHC-Class I-saporin tetramers led to partial (80-90 %) depletion of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells-rapidly followed by a rebound leading to expansion and maintenance of up to 40 % of total CD8(+) T cells, with minimal changes in response to a control epitope (M45).

If a TEL happens to code for a protein that contains a CD8 T cell epitope, protein processing can lead to the presentation of the antigenic peptide and restimulation of cognate CD8 T cells during latency.

These data suggest that HAART quickly starts to restore CD8(+) T-cell responses to other chronic viral infections and leads to a slow decrease in HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response in HIV-infected patients.

Because T-cell receptor engagement of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the absence of costimulation mediated via CD28 binding to CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) can lead to anergy or apoptosis, we determined whether HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virions incorporated MHC class I (MHC-I), MHC-II, CD80, or CD86.

These results indicate that the greater potential breadth of CD8 T cell responses present in heterozygous animals does not necessarily lead to greater antiviral efficacy and suggest that SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in heterozygous animals have a skewed focus toward epitopes restricted by a single haplotype.

Collectively, our findings show that RUNX1 is required for mammary stem cells to exit a bipotent state, and provide a new method for discovering cell-state regulators when markers are not available.

There was a new suggestive association with a low-frequency variant at zinc-finger protein 154 in the AS without AAU versus control analysis (zinc-finger protein 154 (ZNF154), P=2.

Although IL-22 displayed a negligible effect on glial cells in vitro, IL-22-/- mice mounted more vigorous ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which led to a more effective control of ZIKV in the brain.

Reduced tumor and spleen uptake of 89 Zr-DFO-CD8a was observed in CD8a+ depleted mice and the uptake was comparable with that of isotype control (89 Zr-DFO-IgG2b) confirming specificity.

Thus, in addition to gaining more basic information about ZIKV biology, appropriate interventions and management strategies are being sought to control ZIKV-associated diseases and its spread.

This prospective study examined the effects of the new antiepileptic drug (AED) gabapentin (GBP) compared to the standard AED carbamazepine (CBZ) and placebo (PLA) on eye movements, posture and finger force control in 12 healthy volunteers who received single doses of 600 mg GBP and 400 mg CBZ in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial.

We found that HLA-A molecules with poor VZV IE62 presentation capabilities were more common in a cohort of 50 individuals with a history of HZ compared to a nationwide control group, which equated to a HZ risk increase of 60 %.

IMZ/TBZ were given in the diet to provide levels of 0 %/0 % (control), 0.0015 %/0.018 % (IMZ/TBZ), 0.006 %/0.018 % and 0.024 %/0.018 % during the gestation and lactation periods.

Five groups were studied: DZ (DZ pretreatment, n\240\= 8), ischemic control (phosphate-buffered saline pretreatment, n\240\= 11), DZ\240\+ STAT3 inhibitor LY5 (DZ pretreatment\240\+ LY5, n\240\= 8), LY5 (phosphate-buffered saline pretreatment\240\+ LY5, n\240\= 8), and sham (without cross-clamping, n\240\= 5).

Ag-specific cells from the libraries of patients with T1D were reactive with ZnT8186-194, whereas those from healthy control recognized ZnT8186-194 and other Ags.

The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

Thus these findings have identified a novel function for Runx1 in sustaining normal epithelial morphology and preventing EMT and suggest Runx1 levels could be a prognostic indicator of tumor progression.

Previously, it was proposed that CBFβ-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFβ-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression.

We also demonstrated that the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor panobinostat and a MICA/B antibody acted synergistically to enhance MICA/B surface expression on tumor cells.

MG132 increased the transcription of MICB by acting at a site in the 480 ‑bp MICB upstream promoter.

In contrast, the M7 and DK1 HLA-A2 variant cell lines, which express normal HLA-A2 serological determinants, were inefficiently lysed by CTL-8 and did not act as competitive inhibitors of normal HLA-A2 target cells.

These results show that the presence of the Bw4 epitope influences recognition of HLA-B molecules by NK cells that express NKB1, and suggest that the NKB1 molecule may act as a receptor for Bw4+ HLA-B alleles.

Indeed, histidine 59 in HLA-B,27:03 leads to a series of local conformational changes that act in concert to reduce the accessibility of the nearby cysteine 67, an essential amino acid residue for the formation of HLA-B27 homodimers.

Finally, we suggest mechanisms whereby MHC-loading enhancers could act upon MHC class II molecules.

HLA-DM, a nonclassical MHCII protein acts as a peptide exchange catalyst for MHCII, editing the peptide repertoire.

Antigen-presenting cells express another nonclassical MHC-II protein, DM, which acts as a peptide editor by preferentially catalyzing the exchange of less stable MHC-II peptide complexes, and which is inhibited when bound to DO.

The Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrid acts on MHC class II molecules to facilitate replacement of antigenic peptides with the epitope tethered to the Ii-Key motif.

These results support a model in which Nef relocalizes MHC-I by acting as a connector between MHC-I\s cytoplasmic tail and the PACS-1-dependent protein-sorting pathway.

In addition, we showed that a modified CBFβ-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis.

The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain)  expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16) (p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML.

As a potential source of TCRs specific for this TEL-AML1 epitope, we have used mice expressing a human TCR-αβ repertoire and human MHC class I.

CBFbeta-SMMHC is expressed in 8 % of acute myeloid leukemias and inhibits AML1/RUNX1.

MiR-302b functions as a tumor suppressor in EOC by targeting RUNX1 and modulating the activity of the STAT3 signaling pathway.

Notably, RUNX1c/tdTom(+) cells represent only a limited subpopulation of the CD34(+) CD45(+) and CD34(+) CD43(+) cells with a unique genetic signature.

Most important, miR-18a and RUNX1 could reversely regulate the permeability of BTB as well as the expressions and distributions of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5.

Moreover, master regulators of the glioblastoma multiforme mesenchymal phenotype including CEBPb, ZNF238, and FOSL2 were directly regulated by RUNX1.

Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that RUNX1 interacted with " TGGGGT" DNA sequence in promoter region of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 respectively.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that ZNF652 strongly interacts with CBFA2T3 and this interaction occurs through the COOH-terminal 109 amino acids of ZNF652.

MOZ has recently been shown to interact directly with RUNX1, indicating that MOZ fusion proteins act by deregulating RUNX1 function.

Prediction of miR-181b by using the starBase, targetscan and picTar database and its combination with literature reports indicated that CARD11, ZFP36L1, RUNX1, NR4A3, ATP1B1, PUM1 and PLAG1 related with blood diseases, and up-regulated CARD11 and ZFP36L1 participated in lymphoid tumor formation by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell aging.

CONCLUSIONS DEGs and pathways identified in the present study will help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RUNX1 mutations in AML and develop effective therapeutic strategies for RUNX1-mutation AML.

This is the first mouse model of ETV6-RUNX1 to develop BCP-ALL and provides important insight into the cooperating genetic alterations in ETV6-RUNX1 leukemia.

ETV6/RUNX1 and MLL aberration clone size in these cases was suggestive of ETV6/RUNX1 as an early primary event, originating in the embryonic or infant stage and developing into leukemia by later acquisition of MLL aberration, ETV6 loss, and ETV6/RUNX1 duplication as secondary events.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our studies reveal a generalized control mode by Runx1 for pruriceptor development and consolidate a hierarchical control mechanism for the formation of sensory neurons transmitting distinct modalities.

There was cell-to-cell variability, with some cells expressing no CD4 and others expressing high CD4.

Circulating human CD4(+) CD25(high) CD127(-) T reg cells significantly expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-beta mRNA compared with CD4(+) CD25(-) cells.

The CD4 gene is regulated in a stage-specific manner during T cell development, being repressed in CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative (DN) and CD8 cells, but expressed in CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) and CD4 cells.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in CD44(+) CD24(+) SW1222 colon cancer cells expressing Cdx1 (CD44(+) CD24(+) Cdx1(+) stem cells) and CD44(+) CD24(+) HCT116 colon cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 (CD44(+) CD24(+) p53wt stem cells).

Amnion and UCM-MSCs expressed embryonic and MSC markers, such as Oct-4 CD44, CD184, and CD29, whereas AF-MSCs expressed Oct-4, CD44.

The results show that all breast cancer cells overexpress CD74 isoforms, MIF, and CD44, in contrast to the normal cell lines and normal breast tissues, which express only CD44 and MIF in low levels.

To answer this question, we utilized CD44-negative human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN74 manipulated to stably express CD44 standard form (CD44s).

These CD4+ T cells may represent a relatively rare population of T cells that express a T-cell receptor capable of cross-reacting with an MHC class I/peptide complex with sufficient affinity to allow triggering in the absence of the CD4 coreceptor.

Mature bone marrow CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressed similar HLA-A and-B levels as hHSC, while in the peripheral blood they expressed significantly more HLA-B7 (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.004 for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively).

After expansion in culture, the majority of the BKV-specific CD4(+) T cells, in addition to expressing CD40L (CD154), secreted both interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, contained both granzyme A and granzyme B, and degranulated/mobilized CD107 in response to antigen-specific stimulation.

Variants were engineered into the SIVmac239 backbone and in Nef expression plasmids and flow cytometry was used to examine surface tetherin expression in primary CD4 T cells and surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells engineered to express rhesus CD4.

The primary outcome included absolute changes of peripheral blood CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Tregs which measured by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of the total population of CD4+ T lymphocytes at pre-exposure (0-h) and post-exposure (2-h and 24-h) to anesthetic gas.

By contrast, both rat primary CD4+ T cells and established T cell lines expressing human CD4, CCR5, CyclinT1, and CRM1 genes were infected inefficiently, but this was ameliorated by inhibition of cyclophilin A.

Multicolour flow cytometric analysis identified a CD4(+) CD8alphaalpha(+) CD8alphabeta(+) T-cell population in NHPs as well as in human subjects that expressed the degranulation marker CD107a and may represent a unique CD4(+) T-cell subset endowed with cytotoxic capacity.

Activated CD4(+) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha could produce IFN-gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18, while CD4(+) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha could respond to IL-18 alone.

We assume a linear random effects model with subject-specific intercepts and slopes and normal errors for the true log and square root CD4 counts, and a proportional hazards model for AIDS-free survival time expressed as a function of current true CD4 value.

The re-expressed CD28 was functional and restored the ability of CD4(+) CD28(null) T cells to express CD25 and CD40 ligand.

Our studies found that IL-12 but not IL-21 could induce the differentiation of human naive CD4(+) T cells into multi-cytokine expressing CD4(+) T cells in vitro, which co-expressed IL-21 and IFN-γ with or without IL-2 and TNF-α.

The expansion of T CD4(+) IL-17A-F(+) cells, as well as of T CD4(+) cells expressing IL-23Rp19 (T CD4(+) IL-23R(+)), considered as the pathogenic phenotype of effector Th17 cells, was found to be confined to the joints of PsA patients, as the frequencies of both populations were significantly higher in SF than in matched PB, or in PB of HC.

Instead, Shp1(fl/fl) CD4-cre mice had increased frequencies of memory phenotype T cells that expressed elevated levels of CD44.

We found changes of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in highly HIV-exposed, uninfected individuals, with a lower level of naive and CD28(+) T cells and higher levels of HLA-DR(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells expressing CCR5 and memory CD4(+) T cells than in control subjects.

Per(-) GraA(-) GraB(-) and Per(-/low) GraA(+) GraB(-) cells were predominantly found in CCR5(-) CCR7(+) and CCR5(high/low) CCR7(-) subsets, respectively, of CD8(+) T cells expressing the CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) phenotype, whereas Per(low) GraA(+) GraB(+) cells were found in the CCR5(low) CCR7(-) subset of those expressing this phenotype and in a part of the CCR5(-/low) CCR7(-) subset of those expressing the CD27(-/low) CD28(-) CD45RA(-/+) phenotype.

Flow cytometric analyses showed that human CD8+ T cells with naïve (CD27+ CD28+ CD45RA+) or memory (CD27+ CD28+/- CD45RA+) phenotypes included a population expressing a high level of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3high) and one expressing a low level of it (CXCR3low), but those with the effector phenotype (CD27- CD28- CD45RA+/-) included a population that did not express CXCR3 (CXCR3-) and a CXCR3low population.

CD4(+) T cells from infected stomach expressed increased levels of the homing receptor L-selectin and the chemokine receptor CCR4 compared to CD4(+) T cells from uninfected stomach.

SSp-1-specific CTLs expanded from memory T cells of both recovered SARS patients, and the five exceptional healthy donors shared a differentiated effector CTL phenotype, CD45RA(+) CCR7(-) CD62L(-), and expressed CCR5 and CD44.

In comparisons of chemokine receptor expression on naive (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) CD3+ lymphocytes, there were greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes in RA PB and RA SF, and greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes in RA SF, suggesting receptor up-regulation upon lymphocyte activation.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte subpopulations expressing the other chemokine and adhesion receptors (CXCR4, CD11a and CD49d) were reduced to a similar extent as compared with overall CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts.

There were significantly more BAL CD4+ T cells expressing CXCR3, CCR5, IL-12R and IL-18R compared with paired PBL CD4+ T cells.

We demonstrate here that the activated CD4dimCD8bright T cells are not undergoing apoptosis and do not produce significant intracellular levels of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2), or IL-10 but express elevated levels of intracellular IL-4 in comparison to CD8+CD4- and CD4+ T cells.

Chronically infected individuals exhibited striking depletion of GALT CD4(+) T cells expressing CXCR4, CCR5, and alpha E beta 7 integrin, but CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios in blood and GALT were similar.

In the healthy population (n = 30) studied, 24.6 per cent of CD4 T cells expressed CCR5 and the percentage of CD4 T cells expressing CXCR4 was 80.4.

IL-12 failed to prime CD4(+) or CD8(+) healthy clones for high CCL5/regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) production, although its secretion was impaired in CD4(+) clones from IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) and IFN-gammaR1(-/-) patients.

We show differential expression of chemokine receptors among NKT cell subsets: CCR4 is mainly expressed by a high cytokine (interleukin-4/interleukin-2)-producing (CD4) NKT subset, while CCR1, CCR6, and CXCR6 are preferentially expressed by the low cytokine-producing CD8 and CD4(-) CD8(-) subsets.

We have confirmed that CD4⁺ NKT cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) predominantly express CCR5 rather than CXCR4, whereas the reverse is true for CD4⁺ T cells derived from circulating PBMCs, and that R5-tropic HIV-1 expands efficiently in the CD4⁺ NKT cells.

Sooty mangabey CD4(+) T(CM) cells that express low amounts of CCR5 showed reduced susceptibility to SIV infection both in vivo and in vitro when compared to CD4(+) T(CM) cells of rhesus macaques.

It was directly correlated to the number of helper cells, required the continuous presence of the CD4(+) T cells, dependent on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing CD40 and on the formation of CD4/CD8/APC cell clusters.

Analysis of the in vitro induction of Tc17 cells showed that these cells were induced from the CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(+) naive subset and that they expressed the CD27(-) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) and CCR6(+) phenotype.

Although memory CD4 T cells did not express normal activation markers, they displayed a significant up-regulation in the density of CD4 but not CCR5 expression between days 7 and 10 postinfection that correlated with increased plasma IL-15 levels and infection in these cells.

We found a consistent association between the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing HLA-DR and the frequency of resting CD4+ T cells containing HIV DNA.

We found higher levels of activation markers (CD38, HLADR) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, lower percentages of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, higher percentages of CD8+ T cells and of CD8+ T cells expressing CD25, and lower levels of CXCR4+CD4+ T cells in EU IDUs than in unexposed controls.

In addition, using an SI strain of HIV-1 which directs expression of a reporter protein on the surface of infected cells, we have found that the immature CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes that express the highest levels of both CD4 and CXCR4 are the cells that are preferentially infected and depleted by the virus in vitro.

Infection of CD3+ CD8+ CD45RA+ cells was detected in 9 of 16 study subjects at frequencies ranging from 30 to 1, 400 proviral copies/10(6) cells, more frequently than CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes expressing the RO isoform of CD45 (n = 2, 70 and 260 copies/10 (6) cells).

In this study, we explored the therapeutic utility of adoptively transferred CD4+ T\240\cells expressing an HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR4) to restore CD4+ T\240\cell function to the global HIV-specific immune response.

The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients.

Interestingly, most of SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4(+) T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO(+) CCR7(+) CD62L(-).

CD4(+) NKG2D(+) lamina propria lymphocytes from patients with CD highly expressed interleukin-15R alpha, and interleukin-15 increased NKG2D and DAP10 expression in CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T-cell clones.

Although CD45RA- memory PRA(100-108)-specific T cells were found in some individuals, the majority of PRA(100-108)-tetramer+ T cells expressed CD45RA, suggesting a naive phenotype.

In individuals who were HLA-A,0201, CD8(+) T cells that expressed CD45RA and were specific for the pp65 protein (NLVPMVATV epitope) had lower avidity than those that expressed CD45RO and demonstrated decreased cytokine secretion and cytolytic potential after specific activation.

We demonstrate that CD49a is expressed early following T\240\cell activation in\240\vivo, and TGF-β and IL-12 induce CD49a expression by CD8+ T\240\cells in\240\vitro.

In tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), LAG3 expression was highest on CD4+\240\regulatory T cells (Tregs) and was also highly expressed on CD8+\240\T cells compared with CD4+\240\non-Tregs (both\240\P\240\=.

Additionally, trauma plasma did not induce CD4+ T cell expansion but did cause a phenotypic shift towards CD38+/CCR7+ expressing CD4+ T cells.

Sixty-one female SLE patient were measured for CD4 and CD8 T cell-associated senescence markers, including percentage of end-stage differentiated T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CD57+ or loss of CD28 expression), of naïve T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+ and CD8+ CD45RA+), memory T cells (CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+), and antigen-experienced T cells (CD4+ KLRG1+ and CD8+ KLRG1+) which were measured using flow cytometry.

We have demonstrated that tonsillar CD4+ T cell can express various Th effector cytokines after short-term polyclonal stimulation, and that cytokine-producing CD4+ T cells were CD45RO+ T cells.

Immunophenotyping by flowcytometry for measurement of CD4 and CD8 T cell counts was used and the percentages of cells expressing CD4 and CD8 were estimated per lymphocyte population.

Secondary dependent variables were CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells expressing CD45RO + CD45RA- (memory phenotype), CD45RO-CD45RA+ (naïve phenotype), and the naïve phenotype to memory phenotype T-cell ratio (lower ratios associated with immunosenescence).

Vaccination induced durable systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses characterized mainly by CD4+ T cells expressing Th1-type cytokines, as well as RSV-F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgG, and IgA in the respiratory tract.

In addition, Jak3(-/-) CD4(+) T cells express high levels of programmed death-1 and lymphocyte activation gene-3 and modestly suppress the proliferation of wild-type CD4(+) T cells in coculture assays.

Although equivalent amounts of CD45, which acts as a Jak phosphatase, was expressed on the two T cell populations, those on the CD8(+) T cells have less protein tyrosine phosphatase activity than those on the CD4(+) T cells.

Thus, the expression of specific CD45 isoforms on T cells correlates with their proliferative response to IL-2, suggesting that controlling cells expressing specific CD45 isoforms could correct excessive or insufficient immune responses.

In the absence of CCR5, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells expressing Foxp3, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR (GITR), CD103, CD45low, and CTLA-4 in the granulomas was significantly decreased.

Here, we tested the distribution of CD4/CCR5-tropic [ MLV(HIV) ]-pseudotype vectors in transgenic mice expressing CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 of human origin.

Nevertheless, the observation that IIIB gp120 strongly primed tailless CD4 co-down-modulation on human osteosarcoma HOS cells that express undetectable levels of surface CXCR4 raised the possibility that membrane component(s) other than those recently identified can be involved in down-modulation of the CD4/gp120 complexes.

Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) activated fusion between effector cells expressing Env and target cells expressing coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) but lacking CD4.

In contrast, neither SIRC cells expressing CD4 alone nor murine 3 T3 cells expressing CCR5 and CD4 exhibited significant expression of p24.

The expression of CCR5 was largely restricted to the memory (CD45RAlow) subset, whereas CXCR4 was expressed on both memory and naive (CD45RAhigh) T cells.

In CD4 expressing CCR5 and CXCR4 double positive NIH 3 T3 cells, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis revealed that CCR5 was associated with CXCR4 and CD4.

Compared to NIH 3 T3CD4 cells expressing CXCR4, the entry of an HIV-1 X4 isolate (HCF) into NIH 3 T3CD4 expressing both CXCR4 and CCR5 was reduced.

Unlike microglia that express and utilize CD4 and chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CCR3 for HIV-1 infection, astrocytes fail to express CD4.

Although CCL4 and CCL5 expression was higher in livers of infected WSX-1(-/-) mice than infected WT mice, and hepatic CD4⁺ T cells from WSX-1(-/-) mice expressed higher levels of CCR5 than cells from WT mice, migration of CD4⁺ T cells to the liver of WSX-1(-/-) mice during infection was not controlled by chemokine (R) signalling.

HIV-1-resistant cells expressing either CD4 or a coreceptor are often surrounding HIV-1-susceptible cells expressing both CD4 and a compatible coreceptor, in vivo.

Flow cytometric and mRNA analysis of human CD4 in vaginal tissue suggested that HSV-2 infection increased the number of T cells expressing human CD4 in vaginal tissue.

We showed that primary CD4 T cells expressing GPI-scFv X5 were resistant to CCR5 (R5)-, CXCR4 (X4)-, and dual-tropic HIV-1 and had a survival advantage compared to control cells ex vivo In a hu-PBL mouse study, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells were selected in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues upon HIV-1 infection.

Results reported herein show that S1P stimulation of MTB-infected monocytes (i) inhibits intracellular mycobacterial growth, (ii) enhances phagolysosome maturation and the transit of mycobacteria in MHC class II compartments, (iii) increases the frequency of MTB-specific CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing the inflammatory homing receptor CCR5, derived from tuberculosis patients and PPD+, BCG naïve, healthy subjects, and (iv) induces IFN-gamma production in CD4+CD69+CCR5+ T cells derived from PPD+ healthy individuals, only.

Since previous studies of whole allergen immunotherapy demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of allergen-specific (MHC II tetramer+) CD4+ T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CRTh2, we assessed the impact of Cat-PAD on the frequency and functional phenotype of Fel d 1-specific CD4+ T cells.

For laboratory purposes CD40-stimulation is provided by NIH/3T3 cells expressing recombinant human CD40 ligand (tCD40L NIH/3T3).

In a previous report, using purified murine LC, we showed that freshly prepared LC (fLC) do not express CD40, whereas cLC express CD40.

We examined the expression of CD40L on LC and found that both fLC and cLC expressed mRNA for CD40L.

When we examined the cytoplasmic CD40L, however, both fLC and cLC expressed cytoplasmic CD40L.

These results indicate that CD40L is expressed on cLC, and that CD40L on LC modulates the expression of costimulatory molecules such as B7-1 and B7-2 on LC.

CD40, a costimulatory receptor molecule expressed mainly on antigen presenting cells, some non-immune cells and tumors, binds to CD40 ligand molecule expressed transiently on T-cells and non-immune cells under inflammatory conditions.

By developing a bioinformatics platform to dissect antigen-specific responses, we discovered a cell population consisting of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing identical TCRs, herein termed CD4/8 T cells.

Naïve CD4+ T cells co-cultured with LP340 treated dendritic cells highly expressed cytokine receptor IL-27R and were CD49b and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 double positive.

In vitro-simulated ischemia/reperfusion showed that NGAL-deficient CD4+ T cells express higher levels of IFN-γ mRNA compared with WT CD4+ T cells.

Nrp1+Foxp3- CD4 T cells had higher proliferation potential expressed higher levels of the memory marker CD44, and produced more IFN-γ when compared with Nrp1- CD4 T cells.

Mechanistically, we found that CD4 T cells that express Nrp1 have an increased capacity to migrate to the aorta and periaortic lymph nodes compared to Nrp1- T cells, suggesting that the expression of Nrp1 facilitates the recruitment of CD4 T cells into the aorta where they can be pathogenic.

Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of CD4 thymocyte subsets revealed that IL-2 was expressed in self-reactive CD4SP thymocytes, which also contain T reg precursor cells.

In this study, we describe a novel, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific IFN-γ+CD4+ T cell population expressing surface markers characteristic of naive-like memory T cells (TNLM), which were induced in both human (CD45RA+CCR7+CD27+CD95-) and murine (CD62L+CD44-Sca-1+CD122-) systems in response to mycobacteria.

CD4, CD25, CCR6, IL-9, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, STAT6 and Foxp3 expressing GITR+ and CD45+ cells were measured in the spleen using flow cytometry to assess anti-inflammatory effects of AMG487.

Suprisingly, such naïve CD4+ CD45RBhigh T\240\cells failed to express the Il9r or respond to IL-9 in vitro, in contrast with CD4+ CD45RBlow T\240\cells.

10 mice and the α7 nAChR agonist GTS-21, investigation of (1) antigen processing-dependent and (2)-independent, antigen presenting cell (APC)-dependent, naïve CD4+ T cell differentiation, as well as (3) non-specific APC-independent, anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs-induced CD4+ T cell differentiation, revealed the differential roles of α7 nAChRs expressed on T cells and APCs in the regulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation.

CD40 was highly expressed on adipose tissue macrophages in mice, and CD40/CD40L signaling promoted the expression of antigen-presenting cell markers in adipose tissue macrophages.

Thus, in Itk-deficient mice, mature CD4(-) CD8(+) (CD8 single-positive [ SP]) thymocytes express high levels of the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) and are dependent on IL-4 being produced in the thymic environment by a poorly characterized subset of CD4(+) thymocytes expressing the transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger.

The majority of RV and Flu tetramer(+) CD4 T cells in healthy volunteers expressed markers of antigen experienced T cells, but only RV specific CD4 T cells expressed intestinal homing receptors.

This naturally occurs through interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on CD4+ T-helper cells.

CDX-1140 binds outside of the CD40L binding site, and addition of recombinant CD40L greatly enhances DC and B activation by CDX-1140, suggesting that CDX-1140 may act synergistically with naturally expressed CD40L.

Directly ex vivo or with TCR stimulation, LAG-3+ CD4+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β than LAG-3- CD4+ T cells.

Tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells were significantly less potent in expressing IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17, and more potent in expressing IL-10 than circulating CD4+ T cells.

In addition, a subset of the responding CD4+ T cells expressed forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3), indicating that although a regulatory component of the vaccine-activated CD4+ T cell response was induced, the anti-tumor vaccine response was not limited by these regulatory CD4+ T cells.

Further characterization of the CD34+ CD4+ subpopulation demonstrated that these cells expressed lower levels of HLA-DR on their surface compared with CD34+ CD4- cells, suggesting an immature phenotype.

First, BR-derived Envs demonstrated an enhanced ability to interact with CD4 compared with LN-derived Envs, permitting entry into cells expressing scant levels of CD4.

Most CD4 T cells in RA joints expressed memory/activation markers, such as CD45RO, HLA-DR, and CD69.

In mucosal tissues, CD4(+) T cells express high levels of CCR5, and a subset of these CD4(+)/CCR5(high) cells express the integrin α₄β₇, the gut homing receptor.

Our findings point to a differential regulation in the susceptibility to apoptosis of CD4+T cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR3 and suggest an impairment in the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic deletion of CD4+CCR5+T cells in PPMS patients that may lead to their chronic persistence in peripheral blood from these patients.

Specifically, TA1 was triggered by soluble CD4 more readily than the parental Env and, unlike the parental Env, could mediate entry on cells that express low levels of CD4.

The large number of CD4+ T cells in the gut (a large fraction of which are activated and express the HIV/SIV coreceptor CCR5), the high level of infection of these cells, and the temporal coincidence of this CD4+ T-cell depletion with the peak of virus in plasma in acute infection suggest that the intestinal mucosa may be the major source of virus driving the peak viral load.

These variants are able to exploit low amounts of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection and potentially confer an expanded tropism for any cell types that express low CD4 and/or CCR5.

Non-mac-tropic R5 envelopes (Envs) require high CD4 levels for infection contrasting with highly mac-tropic Envs, which interact more efficiently with CD4 and mediate infection of macrophages that express low CD4.

IL-12 and IFN-γ make Naive CD4+ T cells highly express T-bet and STAT4 and differentiate to TH1 cells, while IL-4 make Naive CD4+ T cells highly express STAT6 and GATA3 and differentiated to TH2 cells.

Here we show that some fusions of these CCR5- and CD4-mimetic peptides expressed as immunoadhesins, neutralize HIV-1 more efficiently than CD4-Fc or equimolar mixtures of immunoadhesin forms of each peptide.

We performed entry assays using the CD4- and CCR5-inducible Affinofile cell line expressing a range of CD4 levels that approximates the range from MDMs to CD4(+) T cells.

We have previously shown that human defensin 5 (HD5) promotes HIV infectivity in both primary CD4+ T cells and HeLa cells expressing CD4 and CCR5.

We found that the frequency of memory CD4⁺ T cells that expressed high levels of α₄β₇(high) (α₄β₇(high) memory CD4⁺ T cells) in blood before challenge correlated strongly with susceptibility to infection and acute VL.

However, analysis of cervical mononuclear cells showed that DMPA users had elevated levels of activated T cells (CD4+CD69+) and expressed lower levels of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 on a per cell basis, while tissue samples showed that in the ectocervix, DMPA users had a higher proportion of CD4+CCR5+ T cells.

Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4⁺ HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.

Access and migration of naive and memory CD4+ T cells to these sites is mediated by interactions between integrin α4β7 expressed on CD4+ T cells, and MAdCAM, expressed on high endothelial venules.

While the percentage of CD4+ T cells from SI biopsies expressed significantly more activation markers (CD38, HLA-DR) and HIV coreceptors (CXCR4, CCR5), the absolute numbers of activated CD4+ T cells were similar between both sites.

In the blood and lymphoid system, the major switch late in disease is from T cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 to T cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4, with a change in coreceptor specificity.

Interestingly, the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of integrin α4β1 and α6β1, whereas integrin α4highβ1+β7+ CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of integrin α4β1 and α4β7, suggesting an alternative expression of integrin α6β1 or α4β7 in combination with α4β1 in respective major and minor populations of integrin α4highCD4+ T cells.

The minor population, integrin α4highβ1+β7+ CD4+ T cells, were different from the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells in that they secreted a smaller amount of Th1 cytokines upon stimulation and expressed lower levels of Th1-related chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 than the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells.

R5 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering memory CD4+ T cells, X4 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering naïve CD4+ T cells and Mtropic variants that are adapted to entering macrophages and possibly other cells that express low levels of CD4.

With diminishing CD4+ T cell levels, the capacity to utilize alternate cell types and receptors, including cells that express low CD4 receptor levels such as macrophages, thus becomes crucial.

LAP+CD4+ T cells expressed significantly larger amounts of IL-10 and TGF-β but lower levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17 and interferon-γ, compared with LAP-CD4+ T cells.

CD25(+) FoxP3(+) memory CD4 T cells, often referred to as regulatory CD4 T cells, depend on IL-2 signaling for homeostatic proliferation in vivo Our results show that CD25(+) FoxP3(+) memory CD4(+) T cells often express the HIV coreceptor CCR5, are significantly more proliferative, and contain more HIV DNA than CD25(-) FoxP3(-) memory CD4 T cell subsets.

In addition, roughly half of these CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells expressed CD69, consistent with resident memory T cells, whereas the remaining CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells lacked CD69 expression, consistent with recirculating memory CD4 T cells that traffic between peripheral tissues and lymphoid sites.

In addition, the number of CD4+ CD25+ cells that expressed the primary receptor CD134 was greater than for CD4+ CD25- cells.

The CD45RA CD45RO subset in culture expressed high levels of CD4, CXCR4, and CD69, an early activation marker, and was highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication.

CD4 and GHOST(3)  expressing CD4 and CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR4, CXCR6 or BOB.

Furthermore, a CD4-independent R5 HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein was able to kill CD4-negative target cells expressing CCR5, demonstrating that CD4 is not intrinsically required for the induction of death.

An adenovirus vector (Ad-CD4) was used to express CD4 in CD4(-) astrocytes and thus confer efficient infection if a functional coreceptor is present.

In contrast, HIV-1 replicates in activated human CD4(+) T cells, monocytes, and metabolically active human cells of a variety of cell types become permissive for HIV-1 replication when transduced to express CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4.

Because CD4 T cells around FDCs in germinal centers express the HIV coreceptor, CXCR4, whereas CD4 lymphocytes in many other sites do not, it prompted the hypothesis that FDCs may increase CXCR4 expression on CD4 T cells, thereby facilitating infection.

Furthermore, CD4(+) CD57(+) germinal center T cells expressed high levels of CXCR4 and supported enhanced entry of X4 HIV compared with other CD4 T cells from the same tissue.

All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4.

Mucosal lymphocytes isolated from normal human intestine expressed CD4 (14, 530 +/- 7970 antibody-binding sites [ ABSs]/cell), CCR5 (2730 +/- 1524 ABSs/cell), and CXCR4 (2507 +/- 1840 ABSs/cell), but intestinal macrophages, which also expressed CD4 (2959 +/- 2695 ABSs/cell), displayed no detectable CCR5 or CXCR4 ABS.

CD4 and GHOST(3)-engineered to express stably CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, or the orphan receptors BOB/gpr15 or Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR.

In the experiments using U87-CD4 cells expressing chemokine receptors, the isolates from patients in the late CDC-II stage infected U87-CD4 cells expressing CXCR4, but not U87-CD4 cells expressing CCR5.

Titers in other, CD4- cell lines expressing various coreceptors of HIV-1 were 100-fold lower than titers obtained in CD4+ cells.

Such particles allowed efficient infection of CD4-positive human T lymphocytes, and, at a lower efficiency, also cells expressing CXCR4 without CD4.

Cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated that in KG-1 cells, after HHV-6 infection, more than 40 % of cell population became CD4 positive and only in KG-1 cells expressing the CD4+ phenotype, the exposure to r-gp120 masks a significant amount, not only of CD4, but also of both CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptors.

Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) blocked HIV-1(LAI) infection of cells expressing CD4(2D) CXCR4 less efficiently than for cells expressing wild-type CXCR4 and CD4, whereas down-modulation of CXCR4 by SDF-1 was similar for hybrids and wild-type CXCR4.

However, the binding of virion-associated gp120 to cellular CD4 is often weak, and most cell types that are permissive for HIV-1 infection express little CD4.

Sulfated tyrosines contribute to the binding of CCR5 to MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and HIV-1 gp120/CD4 complexes and to the ability of HIV-1 to enter cells expressing CCR5 and CD4.

Anti-CD4 mAbs mimicked the effect of gp120, and both anti-CD4 Ab and gp120 caused internalization of CXCR4 in HEK 293 cells provided they also expressed CD4.

Infectivities of T-cell-tropic viruses were analyzed in a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that have distinct quantities of CD4 and in human astroglioma U87MG-CD4 cells that express a large quantity of CD4 and become highly susceptible to infection after transfection with a CXCR-4 expression vector.

Infection of cat CCC/CD4 cells transiently expressing Lestr supported infection by T-cell line-adapted strains including LAI, whereas CCC/CD4 cells expressing CCR5 were sensitive to primary non-SI strains as well as to the molecularly cloned strains SF-162 and JR-CSF.

In addition, introduction of fusin and CD4 into a human cell line, U87MG, that is resistant to HIV-1 induced syncytium formation and to infection by HIV-1 when expressing CD4 alone made this cell line permissive for Env-mediated cell-cell fusion.

Cocultured unfused E6 cells showed a marked decrease in CD4 expression, suggesting the selective recruitment of cells strongly expressing CD4 into syncytia.

We found that transduction mediated by Env proteins of CD4-independent HIV-1 strains increased up to 5.5-fold in cells expressing unglycosylated CXCR4, suggesting that the CXCR4 glycan inhibits CD4-independent X4 virus infection.

The inoculum virus (SIVsm isolate SMM-3) and reisolates obtained early in infection often showed a pronounced CD4-independence since virus production and/or syncytia induction could be detected directly in NP-2 cells expressing CCR5 but not CD4 (CD4-independent-HIGH).

This difference is associated with the expression of the CCR5 co-receptor on approximately 70 % of CD4 T cells in rectosigmoid tissue, whereas in tonsillar tissue it is expressed on fewer than 15 % of CD4 T cells.

CD4 molecules are expressed at the cell surface of lymphocytes and monocytes mainly as monomers, but basal levels of CD4 dimers are also present at the cell surface of these cells.

Specific and efficient gene transfer into CD4/CXCR4 expressing cell lines and stimulated primary human CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes was achieved.

Antibody (IgG, IgG3 binding, and neutralizing) and CD4+ T-cell (expressing interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and CD40 ligand) responses were evaluated at month 6.5 for all participants and at months 12, 12.5, and 18 for a randomly selected subset.

Previous research has shown that LT-β is produced mainly by CD4⁺T cells in rhesus macaques, while our study found the same level of LT-β expressed by CD4⁺T and CD8⁺T cells in humans.

Induction of association was not mediated by inside-out signaling via the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p58lck, since it was not inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbymicin and genistein, nor by CD45 bridging between CD4 and the associating molecule, since similar patterns of association were detected IN cells expressing different CD45 isoform patterns.

The soluble component was secreted by both CD4 and CD8 T cells, was not unique to CD28 costimulation, and could be neutralized by removal of C-C chemokines (RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and-1 beta) from the culture supernatants of costimulated CD4 T cells.

Enhanced stimulation of env-specific CD4+ T cell clones by APC expressing the env protein and the CD4-LAMP-1 chimera was readily demonstrated in both cytotoxicity assays and proliferation assays.

Furthermore, cell-surface CD4 down-modulation by phorbol myristate acetate or anti-CD4 mAbs was similar in the two subsets, which express the same amounts of both cell-surface CD4 and CD4-associated p56lck.

In normal brain, CD4 antigen was expressed on perivascular microglial cells, a specialized microglia expressing monocytic markers, whereas in HIV1-infected brain, CD4+ cells were numerous and scattered throughout the whole parenchyma.

At concentrations which readily kill HIV-infected T cells, CD4(178)-PE40 has no observable cytotoxic effects on uninfected human cell lines expressing surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecules, and does not interfere with cellular responses known to be dependent on functional association between CD4 and MHC Class II molecules.

We found that T cells infected with viruses expressing Nef alleles from the CD4low SM group expressed significantly higher levels of the CD69, interleukin (IL)-2 and programmed death (PD)-1 receptors than those expressing Nefs from the CD4high group.

Breast milk T cells were predominantly CD45RO(+) HLADR(+) and expressed low levels of CD45RA, CD62L, and CCR7 consistent with an effector memory population.

Lmo2 knockdown decreased CD4 expression, while inhibition of intracellular NOTCH1 or histone deacetylase activity induced CD4 expression.

The findings indicate that HA and CD44 increase in epidermal keratinocytes in the premalignant hyperplasia induced by UV irradiation and stay elevated in dysplasia and SCC, suggesting that the accumulation of hyaluronan and CD44 is an early marker for malignant transformation and may be a prerequisite for tumor formation.

While the therapeutic vaccine primed the tumor-reactive CD8+ CTLs and CD4+ effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) compartment inducing activation, tumor infiltration, and tumor rejection or delay in tumor growth, treatment with Ontak 1 day prior to vaccination resulted in enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-mediated vaccine-specific immune responses in the periphery.

To test whether the regulatory functions of the induced CD4(+) CD25(high) Treg cells after transplantation require antigen-specific triggering, we analyzed the capacity of induced CD4(+) CD25(high) Treg cells to inhibit the proliferation of conventional CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells in response to T-cell receptor stimulation using donor cells or HLA-mismatched third-party cells in vitro.

These CD4+CD25- T cells were induced to differentiate into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs through incubating with CD3 and CD28 antibodies, TGF-β, IL-2 and rapamycin in vitro.

Flow cytometry was applied to analyze the expressions of PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, mTGF-β, LAP, CD39, mIL-10 and cIL-10, by the induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs.

(1) The induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs of both healthy controls and SLE patients both highly expressed PD-1.

(4) The expressions of CD39 and mIL-10 displayed scarce significant differences between healthy controls and SLE patients, while the expressions of cIL-10 by the induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in SLE patients were significantly increased, which were not correlated with SLEDAI.

Moreover, local blockade of the common IL-2R/IL-15R beta-chain reduced NK cell number and IL-2 production by lung CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells while inducing IL-10- and TGF-beta-producing CD4(+) T cells in the lung.

Anti-CD4 antibodies induce long-term graft survival by incompletely understood mechanisms, and CD4-ligation with HIV gp120-derivatives attenuates interleukin (IL)-2 receptor signaling.

Small CD45RBhigh CD4+ T lymphocytes and activated CD4+ T blasts induced early (6-12 wk posttransfer) and severe disease, while small resting and unfractionated CD4+ T cells or CD45RBlow T lymphocytes induced a late-onset disease 12-16 wk posttransfer.

Furthermore, in a DC:CD4+ T cell co-culture system, blockade of TIM-4 on DC significantly inhibited T helper-2 cell differentiation and facilitated induced CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cell (iTreg) expansion.

Here we have characterized a primary CD4-independent HIV-1 isolate (92 UG046-T8) with a truncated cytoplasmic tail that was able to infect and induce syncytia in primary lymphocytes from human, chimpanzee, and monkey, as well as CD4-negative cell lines from human and monkey.

Infection with CXCR4 and CCR5-tropic HIV requires initial binding to CD4, and chemotaxis induced by the CCR5-tropic envelope has been reported to be strictly dependent on CD4 binding.

We demonstrate that, in contrast to CD4-dependent gp120 signaling via CCR5, envelope signaling through CXCR4 is CD4 independent inducing chemotaxis of both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

The results suggest that immunization with SIV grown in human CD4(+) T cells induces CD8-suppressor factor, RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta which may block CCR5 receptors and prevent the virus from binding and fusion to CD4(+) cells.

Physiological activation of CD8-alpha/beta+ CD4- T cell receptor-alpha/beta+ neonatal T cells, including activation by allogeneic dendritic cells induces the accumulation of CD4 messenger RNA and the expression of CD4 Ag on the cell surface.

Both CD40L and LAG-3 have been used as vaccine adjuvants to induce CTL and CD4 Th1 responses.

D2 CD4 T cells induce a strong Th1/CMI pathway that is characterized by IL-2/IFN-γ expression, help for CD8 CTLs, and skewing of dendritic cell (DC) subsets toward CD8a DCs, coupled with reduced CD4 T follicular helper cells and transient B cell help.

These results demonstrate that HDAC1 and HDAC2 maintain integrity of the CD4 lineage by repressing Runx-CBFβ complexes that otherwise induce a CD8(+) effector T cell-like program in CD4(+) T cells.

Furthermore, immunization of HLA-DR transgenic mice with a mixture of the two immunodominant human VP11/12 CD4+ TEM cell epitopes, but not with cryptic epitopes induced HSV-specific polyfunctional IFN-γ-producing CD107ab+ CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity against ocular herpes infection and disease.

Immunization of HLA-DR transgenic mice with a mixture of these two immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes induced a robust antiviral CD4+ T cell response in the cornea that was associated with protective immunity against ocular herpes.

In basal culture conditions, CD40 signaling could be induced by the transient establishment of inter-fibroblastic CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) functional bridges.

These interacted with the IL-15 receptor complex on CD4(+) T cells, thus activating the Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation signalling pathway to induce CD40 ligand expression, T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production.

Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events.

Moreover, EGCG alleviates CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) CD25(-) T cell transfer induced colitis with less accumulation of CD4(+) T cells in the colon.

Comparative experiments with two molecular clones of HIV-1 (X4 SF2 and R5 SF162) and two envelope recombinant viruses generated from these viruses showed that R5 viruses (SF162 and the chimeric env-SF162-SF2) caused an extensive depletion of human CD4(+) T cells in SCID mice at both 2 h and 2 weeks after reconstitution, while the X4 viruses (SF2 and the chimeric env-SF2-SF162) induced CD4 T-cell depletion only when infection was performed at the 2-h reconstitution time.

IL-16 binds to CD4 and induces a migratory response in CD4(+) T cells.

Although it has been assumed that CD4 is the sole receptor and that IL-16 induces a comparable migratory response in all CD4(+) T cells, this has not been investigated.

However, when HIV-1-resistant cells expressing CD4 or a coreceptor or lacking both were mixed with HIV-1-susceptible cells and inoculated with HIV-1, all these HIV-1-resistant cells were similarly incorporated into syncytia induced by HIV-1, indicating a CD4- and coreceptor-independent incorporation of HIV-1-resistant cells into syncytia.

Intracellular cytokine assay showed that CD103(+) LDCs induced greater frequencies of CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-γ and IL-17A, whereas CD11b(high) LDCs were more efficient at inducing CD4(+) T cells producing IL-4 and IL-10.

Results reported herein show that S1P stimulation of MTB-infected monocytes (i) inhibits intracellular mycobacterial growth, (ii) enhances phagolysosome maturation and the transit of mycobacteria in MHC class II compartments, (iii) increases the frequency of MTB-specific CD4+CD69+ T cells, expressing the inflammatory homing receptor CCR5, derived from tuberculosis patients and PPD+, BCG naïve, healthy subjects, and (iv) induces IFN-gamma production in CD4+CD69+CCR5+ T cells derived from PPD+ healthy individuals, only.

These results suggest that in HIV infected patients the interaction of gp120 with CD4 induces unresponsiveness of CD4+ T cells to subsequent activation by antigen.

Our findings indicate that HIV-evoked CXCR4 signaling promotes CCR7-dependent CD4 T cell migration by up-regulating CCR7 function, which is likely to be induced by increased formation of CCR7 homo- and CXCR4/CCR7 hetero-oligomers on the surface of CD4 T cells.

Using a coculture model of BM T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we observed that BM CD4+ cells from hypoxic mice induced erythroid output more easily, in agreement with the erythroid-enhancing effect observed for Th2-condition-cultured BM CD4+ cells.

spiralis AES- and MES-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) possessed abilities not only to present antigens to sensitized CD4+ T cell to stimulate their proliferation but also to induce naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate to Treg cells secreting IL-10 and TGF-β.

Hispidulin at a concentration up to 50 μM also suppressed IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner without inducing cell death, and without a change in total frequencies of CD4+ T cells among different concentration groups.

In the present study, using an IL-10 deficient mice model, we found that IL-10 deficiency prevented the reduction of splenic lymphocytes (CD45+ cells) induced by PCV2 and promoted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in lungs through inducting more T cell chemokines (CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10).

The CD4 deprivation induced by MnTBAP had functional consequences on CD4-dependent infectious processes or immunological responses as shown in various models, including gene therapy.

Here, we use next-generation sequencing of the αβT cell receptor of CD4(+) T cells from mice stimulated with PSA in comparison with protein antigen simulation and non-immunized controls and found that PSA immunization induced clonal expansion of a small subset of suppressive CD4(+) CD45RB(low) effector/memory T cells.

In contrast to human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) which significantly induced allogeneic T cell activation and proliferation, hiPSCs failed to induce allogeneic CD45+ lymphocyte and CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation but could induce a low level of allogeneic CD4+ T cell proliferation.

In line with this observation, transfer of OVA-loaded CD11c(int) MHCII(hi) DC from Nb-treated mice into naive hosts could sensitize OVA-specific CD4(+) T cells to IL-4 production, whereas transfer of CD11c(int) MHCII(hi) DC from naive mice, or CD11c(hi) MHCII(int) DC from Nb-treated or naive mice induced CD4(+) T cell expansion but no IL-4 production.

Weak stimulation of CD4(+) T cells induces expansion of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and can also promote T helper (Th) 2 responses, which have demonstrable beneficial effects on autoimmune diabetes.

DCs exposed to PF had diminished capacity to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation and to activate IFN-γ-producing CD4⁺ T cells and induced CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ T cells and IL-10-producing T cell expansion from naïve CD4⁺ T cells.

The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA-/- mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion.

Because the inclusion of CD4 in a vaccine formulation should be avoided, due to potential autoimmune reactions, we engineered small sized CD4 mimetics (miniCD4s) that are poorly immunogenic and do not induce anti-CD4 antibodies.

Pathogenic HIV and SIV infections characteristically deplete central memory CD4(+) T cells and induce chronic immune activation, but it is controversial whether this also occurs after vaccination with attenuated SIVs and whether depletion or activation of CD4(+) T-cell play roles in protection against wild-type virus challenge.

The mechanism of upregulation of A3G mRNA involves interaction between HLA on DC and TCR of CD4(+) T cells, which is ZAP70 and downstream ERK phosphokinase signalling dependent and induces CD40L and A3G mRNA expression in CD4(+) T cells.

Soluble forms of CD4 (sCD4) and small-molecule CD4 mimics (here exemplified by JRC-II-191) also induce these conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, but typically inhibit HIV-1 entry into CD4-expressing cells.

Despite mimetic substitutions, including a glycine-to-(d)-proline change, the gp120 conformation induced by CD4M47 was as close or closer to the conformation induced by CD4 as the one induced by the parent CD4M33.

It can be proposed that exposure of resting CD4+ T cells to pathogen-derived products that can engage TLR2 induces the acquisition of an effector-like phenotype in naive and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, a phenomenon that might result in an acceleration of virus replication, immune dysregulation, and HIV-type 1-mediated disease progression.

Compared to an ADA (R5) gp140, the NL4-3 (X4) construct revealed an overall higher antibody accessibility, which was most pronounced for the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), but also observed for mAbs against CD4 induced (CD4i) epitopes and gp41 mAbs.

Whereas SIV-infected RM show selective numeric preservation of CD4(+) T(SCM), SIV infection induced a complex perturbation of these cells defined by depletion of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T(SCM), increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and high levels of direct virus infection.

Such a piggyback mechanism may provide insight into the formation or presentation of CD4-like antigens from CMV, HTLV, EBV and sperm proteins with class II MHC-like antigens on HIV (gp160 and Nef proteins) and may break immunological tolerance inducing the autoimmunity observed against both CD4+ and class II MHC+ T cells in AIDS patients.

Depletion of Tregs significantly increased the numbers of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells and improved their cytokine production, whereas it induced only very little CD4(+) T cell cytotoxicity.

Given that CD4(+) T cell activation drives the initial burst of viral replication, we explored in macaques whether an oral vaccine comprised of Lactobacillus plantarum, a commensal bacterium that favors immune tolerance, and inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus mac239 (SIVmac239) would induce CD4(+) T cell unresponsiveness/tolerance toward SIV antigens and thereby prevent the establishment of SIV infection.

Thus, while about 60 % of CB CD4+ T cells could efficiently activate STAT6 in response to IL-4, less than 5 % of CB CD4+ T cells were able to activate the JAK/STAT pathway in response to IFN-γ, IL-12 or IL-2.

It is well established that paracrine secretion of anti-viral CCR5 ligands by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can block the infection of activated CD4+ T cells by R5 and dual-tropic isolates of HIV-1.

This protection is selective for CD4+ T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands in that activated CD4+ T cells in the same cultures remain infectable with R5 HIV-1.

Additionally, the present study established a physiologically more relevant model of EC interactions with resting CD4+ T cells and further highlighted the importance of investigating the roles of EC in HIV infection and latency in both resting and activated CD4+ T cells.

Despite this central role, the basis for pox-specific CD4+ T cell activation, specifically the origin of the poxvirus-derived peptides (epitopes) that activate CD4+ T cells, remains poorly understood.

We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells.

This was observed although recovered CD4(+) T cells contain a high proportion of activated memory CD4(+) T cells, ie, the preferential targets of HIV, and are susceptible to productive infection with CXCR4-tropic HIV.

Envs with two CD4mc bound were activated for infection of CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cells, but the infection of CD4-positive, CCR5-positive cells was inhibited.

Because CXCR4 is the major coreceptor for the highly cytopathic X4-tropic HIV-1 strains, which preferentially replicate in proliferating CD4+ T cells, the ability of anti-CD28 to up-regulate the surface expression of CXCR4 in both resting and activated CD4+ T cells provides one relevant mechanism for the progression of HIV-1 disease.

Although CD4+ T-cell activation has long been shown to promote infection and replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV, recent studies have documented that not all activated CD4+ T cells from human and nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV/SIV, respectively.

Furthermore, we also demonstrate that in resting CD4 T cells, actin polymerization can be triggered through transient treatment with a pharmacological agent, okadaic acid, that activates LIMK and promotes HIV latent infection of resting CD4 T cells.

Specificity of the decoy was demonstrated by its ability to directly block Stat6 binding to a cis-element probe and transactivation, but not affect Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation or expression of the IL-4 receptor chains.

We show that an inhibitor of protein phosphatases (PPs) PP1/PP2A, calyculin A, induces (i) phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine and threonine residues, (ii) inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity, and (iii) relocation of STAT3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Restimulation of Th1 or Th2 cells via CD3 plus CD28 induced production of IFN-gamma or IL-4, respectively, but did not alter the activation status/DNA binding activity of STATs.

Although expression of the Jak3 tyrosine kinase in T lymphocytes has been thought to be restricted to mature activated cells, mutations of Jak3 can lead to the development of a human severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by an absence of peripheral T lymphocytes.

In this study, we attempted to find a new target for JAK that is directly activated by JAK, independent of gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation, by using a yeast two-hybrid system.

To determine whether JAKs play a role in activating a signal transduction pathway different from the classical JAK/STAT pathway, we analyzed the ability of huIL-4 to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of one of its major cellular substrates, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS).

Thus, the box1 domain of the Epo-R specifies Jak2 activation and functions efficiently within a heterologous IL2 receptor complex that normally activates Jak1 and Jak3.

In addition, IL-4 and IL-7 induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and JAK1, and IL-4 activated both JAK3 and JAK1 phosphotransferase activity.

Nonetheless, a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2R beta (Asn240-Leu335) was critical for JAK3 activation, and the amount of JAK3 present in activated IL-2 receptor complexes increased with time, suggesting that stabilization of JAK3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma.

The observation that IL-2 and IFN alpha activate JAK1 to a comparable degree, but only IFN alpha activates STAT1, indicates that JAK1 activation is not the only determining factor for STAT1 activation.

We now find that LCLs transformed by EBV recombinants that express Flag-LMP1 with the putative JAK3 binding and activating intermediate domain deleted and LCLs transformed by Flag-LMP1 EBV recombinants have similar levels of phosphotyrosine-activated JAK3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), or STAT5 and similar very low levels of JAK3 associated with LMP1.

Although these data indicate that the LMP1 putative JAK3 binding and activating intermediate domain does not mediate JAK3 association or activation in B-lymphocytes, JAK3 association with LMP1 could be significant, particularly in cells in which LMP1, JAK3, or a JAK3-associated protein is expressed at high levels.

These results also document that the requirement for interaction between gammac and JAK3 is different to activate different signaling pathways mediated by gammac, such as c-fos, c-myc, and JAK-STAT.

For signal transduction through IL-4R and IL-13R, we have demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells, Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 is phosphorylated and activated instead of JAK3 tyrosine kinase.

Although JAK3(V674A) and the majority of other JAK3 mutants needed to bind to a functional cytokine receptor complex to constitutively activate STAT5, JAK3(L857P) was unexpectedly found to not depend on such receptor complexes for its activity, which was induced without receptor or JAK1 co-expression.

Indeed, cells that originally showed a JAK1-activating mutation became resistant to inhibitors by acquiring another activating mutation in JAK3, whereas cells that originally showed a JAK3-activating mutation became resistant to inhibitors by acquiring another activating mutation in JAK1.

Protein modeling and homology analyses of mutations present in other members of the JAK family suggested that these mutations likely activate JAK3, possibly by disrupting the activation loop and the interface between N and C lobes, increasing the accessibility of the catalytic loop.

Among the transcription factors that are known to be activated by JAK3, we explored the phenotype of Stat6-deficient DCs which is a transcription factor specifically activated by JAK3.

As to the molecular signaling cascade linking AMPK to STAT3, we disclosed that AMPK suppressed STAT3 not only by attenuating JAK signaling but also by activating nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a redox-regulating transcription factor, which consequently increased the expression of small heterodimer protein (SHP), thus repressing the transcriptional activity of STAT3.

As expected for cytokines that use gammac, recent studies indicate that IL-21 induces Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK3 activation to initiate signal transduction, but unlike these other gammac-dependent cytokines, which predominantly activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), IL-21 preferentially activates STAT1 and STAT3.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinases, Jak1 and Jak3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate specific STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription), such as STAT5.

These results indicate that STATs are activated through cytokine receptors by two distinct mechanisms, one dependent on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the other mediated by the JAK-STAT direct interaction.

We also provide evidence that the IRS pathway is independent of STAT-6, showing that JAK1 is essential for activating a STAT-independent pathway.

These data suggest that STATs can be activated directly by Bcr/Abl, possibly bypassing JAK family kinase activation.

These results clearly indicated that gamma c is essential for activation of Jak3 and STAT6 in the signal transduction pathway of IL-4 in human B cells and that IL-13 does not utilize gamma c but activates STAT6 through an alternative pathway, which is not impaired in B cells of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency patients.

Less efficient interactions between R5X4 strains and CCR5 may be responsible for the inability to use CCR5 on lymphocytes, which express relatively low CCR5 levels.

So far, in vitro selection for variants resistant to the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C in PBMC (which express both CCR5 and CXCR4) has resulted in mutants that were resistant to the blocker but still used CCR5.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that HHV-6 increases the production of the CCR5 ligand RANTES (\ regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\), the most potent HIV-inhibitory CC chemokine, and that exogenous RANTES mimics the effects of HHV-6 on HIV-1, providing a mechanism for the selective blockade of CCR5-tropic HIV-1.

The absence of CCR5 on intestinal macrophages was not due to expression of the Delta32 deletion allele because matched-blood monocytes expressed CCR5.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid constructs that carry the SIV or SIV-MuLV chimeric Env protein genes and were overlaid with either CEMx174 cells or Ghost Gpr15 cells, which express the Gpr15 coreceptor for SIV, or Ghost CCR5 cells, which express CCR5, an alternate coreceptor for SIV.

Similarly, CCR5 protein, the major macrophage-tropic HIV-1 coreceptor, was not expressed in freshly isolated HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells, although the transcript for CCR5 was identified in these cells.

In wt/del individuals, del CCR5 mRNA was expressed at 10-fold greater levels than wt CCR5 mRNA in unstimulated PBMCs from the same individual.

In contrast, both macrophage-tropic SIVmac316 and T cell-tropic SIVmac239, which in addition to CD4 require CCR5 coreceptor for entry, significantly enhanced early MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling in Jurkat cells expressing constitutively or transiently the CCR5 receptor.

Viral Env utilization of CCR5 expressed on 293-T cells does not always correlate with the cellular tropism of the virus, and one possible explanation is that Env-accessible interaction sites on CCR5 differ on different cell types.

We therefore analyzed binding of several anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to cell lines and primary cells that express this chemokine receptor and found that whereas all antibodies bound to CCR5-transfected 293 T cells, several did not bind to PBMC.

We also studied whether dualtropic primary isolates (able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4) were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the same antibodies when entering U87MG-CD4 cells stably expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4.

We highlight evidence supporting the hypothesis that enhanced M-tropism of R5 HIV-1 results from adaptive viral evolution, resulting in HIV-1 variants that have increased ability to utilise relatively low levels of CCR5 expressed on macrophages, by way of increased CCR5 affinity.

Interestingly, even though CCR5 is expressed on far fewer T cells than is CXCR4, many patients in early- and late-stage HIV disease maintain high levels of CCR5-tropic (R5) viruses.

Although several of the analyzed receptors (including CCR6, CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR5) were not differentially expressed on gammadelta vs alphabeta T cells, gammadelta T cells expressed strongly increased levels of the RANTES/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/-1beta receptor CCR5 and also enhanced levels of CCR1-3 and CXCR1-3.

Sustained infection by viruses encoding the V3-to-V5 region of V1CSF was detected in CrFK cells expressing human CCR3 or CCR5 but not in cells expressing CXCR4 alone, while all CrFK cell lines were permissive to viruses encoding the V3-to-V5 region of Petaluma.

An indium (111 In)-labeled CXCR4 antagonist peptide, [ 111 In]Ac-TZ14011, discussed in a separate chapter of MICAD (9), was developed for the scintigraphic imaging of xenograft tumors that express CXCR4 in mice, and its biodistribution was also investigated in the animals (10).

As CXCR4 is highly expressed on GICs and glioma tumor sites, meanwhile, the activation of CXCR4 induces the receptor-stimulated macropinocytosis pathway in GICs, this CXCR4 receptor-stimulated lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (SLNP) achieves efficient accumulation in GICs in vitro and in vivo.

CXCL12, the natural ligand for CXCR4, and the small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, bound the proteoliposomes with affinities close to those associated with the binding of these molecules to cells expressing CXCR4 and CD4.

Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) up-regulate the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CD4 T cells, and a major subpopulation of germinal center (GC) T cells (CD4(+) CD57(+)), which are adjacent to FDCs in vivo expresses high levels of CXCR4.

We therefore reasoned that GC T cells would actively migrate to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12), the CXCR4 ligand, and tested this using Transwell migration assays with GC T cells and other CD4 T cells (CD57(-)) that expressed much lower levels of CXCR4.

However, the binding of R5 gp120 to N11Q-CXCR4 and entry of R5 HIV-1 viruses into cells expressing N11Q-CXCR4 were 20-and 100-to 1000-fold less efficient, respectively, than the levels achieved using X4 gp120 or X4 HIV-1 viruses.

New directions on CKR-5 research are discussed, such as antagonizing the CKR-5 receptor as a treatment option, testing more people for the defective CKR-5 gene, whether CKR-5 is involved in the rare cases of persons who are HIV-negative, and whether people with one defective gene in the CKR-5 receptor molecule progress more slowly in the disease.

Because CCR5 mediates Treg homing and proliferation, we determined the outcome of antagonizing TNF-α in CCR5(-/) (-) mice infected with Histoplasma capsulatum.

The entry pathway affected was CCR5 dependent, as antagonizing CCR5 with the small molecule inhibitor TAK779 completely blocked entry.

The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are required for HIV-1 to enter cells, and the progression of HIV-1 infection to AIDS involves a switch in the co-receptor usage of the virus from CCR5 to CXCR4.

Viral resistance to small molecule allosteric inhibitors of CCR5 is well documented, and involves either selection of preexisting CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants or envelope sequence evolution to use inhibitor-bound CCR5 for entry.

Our results indicate that a likely mechanism for ligand-directed sorting of CCR5 involves capacity of the chemokine analogs to elicit the formation of durable complexes of CCR5 and arrestin2 (beta-arrestin-1), with PSC-RANTES eliciting durable association in contrast to 5 P14-RANTES, which elicits only transient association.

As it was previously demonstrated that C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may be involved in inflammatory migration of DCs, the aim of this study was to investigate CCR5-driven migration of tolDCs.

Considering the " renaissance of CCR5 research" this article is useful for updating researchers who develop studies involving CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 in different infectious diseases.

C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 (CCR5) is the main HIV-1 coreceptor involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread during acute and chronic infections: such CCR5 and T cell tropic viruses are adapted to and replicate in CD4+ memory T cells.

T-cell surface CCR5 density, which is constant over time for a given individual, but varies drastically among individuals, might therefore be an important personal determinant of T-cell migration in many biological situations where CCR5-binding chemokines play a role, such as graft rejection, T helper 1-mediated auto-immune diseases, and infectious diseases involving CCR5.

In summary, we have shown that CCR5 is mechanistically involved in dissemination of gastric cancer cells, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors of CCR5 might be exploited for their anticancer potential.

In addition, examination of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) genotype, recently reported as involved in severe influenza virus disease, revealed that the F virus-infected patient was homozygous for the deleted form of CCR5 receptor (CCR5Δ32).

On the basis of the possibility that a MOR-CCR5 heteromer is involved in such cross-talk, we have synthesized bivalent ligands (MCC series) that contain mu opioid agonist and CCR5 antagonist pharmacophores linked through homologous spacers (14-24 atoms).

Interaction of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120/CD4 complex involves its amino-terminal domain (Nt-CCR5) and requires sulfation of two to four tyrosine residues in Nt-CCR5.

We found that (i) these receptors expressed alone are confined into 1-microm-sized domains, (ii) CD4-CCR5 associations occur outside and inside smaller domains, and (iii) these interactions involve multiple CCR5 molecules per CD4.

Small-molecule CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc (MVC), likely block HIV-1 through an allosteric, noncompetitive inhibition mechanism, whereas inhibition by agonists such as PSC-RANTES is less defined and may involve receptor removal by cell surface downregulation, competitive inhibition by occluding the HIV-1 envelope binding, and/or allosteric effects by altering CCR5 conformation.

We have recently demonstrated that the CCR5Delta32 protein interacts with CCR5 and CXCR4 and down-modulates their cell surface expression.

The structural basis for CCR5 coreceptor function has been studied in a limited number of prototype strains and suggests that R5 and R5X4 Envs interact differently with CCR5.

In contrast to previous reports in which CCR5 antagonist-resistant viruses interact predominantly with the N terminus of CCR5, these MVC-resistant Envs were also dependent upon the drug-modified ECLs of CCR5 for entry.

The crystal structure of CCR5 shows that the aromatic side chains of F189, W190 and F193 point away from the binding pocket and interact with the membrane or with an adjacent CCR5 molecule, and therefore could not interact with gp120 in the intact CCR5 receptor.

We conclude that diverse CCR5 sequences occur in AGMs and mice, that SIVmac251 and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates interact differently with specific CCR5 amino acids, and that multiple regions of human CCR5 contribute to its coreceptor functions.

Genetic experiments suggested that the active traptamers specifically interacted with the transmembrane domains of CCR5 and that some of the traptamers interacted with different portions of CCR5.

Taking the results together, this study identified the molecular basis by which LukED targets CCR5, highlighting the divergent molecular interactions evolved by HIV-1 and LukED to interact with CCR5.

While the molecular interaction of CCR5 and HIV-1 is well characterized, the means by which LukED interacts with CCR5 is less clear.

A calculated docking model for Nt-CCR5(1-27) suggests that residues 2-22 of Nt-CCR5 interact with the bases of V3 and C4, while the C-terminal segment of Nt-CCR5(1-27) points toward the target cell membrane, reflecting an Nt-CCR5 orientation that differs by 180 ° from that of a previous model.

Concerning the mechanism of inhibition of the Gal-AMD3100 conjugates, experiments performed with X4 or R5HIV-1 strains and GHOST cells genetically modified to express CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 indicated clearly that the conjugates interact with CXCR4 and not with CCR5.

A comparison between the CCL5 : CCR5 and the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop : CCR5 complex structures depicts that both the chemokine and the virus primarily interact with the same CCR5 residues.

It has previously been demonstrated that there are two distinct mechanisms for genetic resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conferred by the CCR5Delta32 gene: the loss of wild-type CCR5 surface expression and the generation of CCR5Delta32 protein, which interacts with CXCR4.

However, virus breakthrough was observed earlier in the presence of CCR5-targeting agents than in presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was associated with a change in sensitivity to TAK-779 or AMD3100, virus coreceptor expansion to CXCR4 and changes in the V3 loop region of gp120.

Viral selection of CCR5 is associated with the early stages of infection, and transition to selection of CXCR4 indicates disease progression.

In this study, we examined the expression of Th1 associated chemokine and cytokine receptors CXCR3, CCR5, and interleukin (IL)-12 R, IL-18R, respectively, as well as of the Th2 associated chemokine receptors CCR4 and CXCR4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Following the cross-linking of CCR5, monocytes synthesized high levels of M-CSF, RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta associated with a readily detectable down modulation of CD14, CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 expression.

These are important questions to consider given the development of new CCR5 blocking therapies and the prognosis associated with CXCR4 use.

In this study, HIV-1 populations that maintained CCR5 usage during infection were compared with populations that switched coreceptor usage to include CXCR4 later during infection, with the aim to find molecular properties of the virus populations associated with the CCR5-to-CXCR4 switch.

CCR5 (R5) tropic viruses are associated with early stages of infection, whereas CXCR4 (X4) HIV-1 tropism has been associated with severe immunodeficiency.

The co-receptor CCR5 is associated with primary infection by macrophage-tropic virus isolates, whereas CXCR4 is commonly associated with T cell- and dual-tropic viruses.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) variants are associated with faster disease progression than CCR5-tropic variants in HIV infection.

However, the presence of viruses able to use CXCR4 for entry was marginally associated with the CCR5 Δ32 genotype in the nongenome-wide analysis.

Moreover, in most instances CXCR4 use as viral entry co-receptor is associated with maintenance of CCR5 use.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 variants are associated with faster disease progression compared with CCR5-tropic variants.

Six of the isolates exhibited syncytia induction (SI) associated with CXCR4 coreceptor usage while three of the isolates were non-syncytia-inducing (NSI) isolates associated with CCR5 coreceptor usage.

To test whether a block to CCR5 promotes the replication of viruses that enter cells via CXCR4 and are associated with accelerated disease progression, we administered a small molecule CCR5 inhibitor, CMPD 167, to three macaques dual-infected with both R5 (SIVmac251) and X4 (SHIV-89.

Human immunodeficiency viruses initiate infections via CCR5 coreceptors and then change their tropism to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), this change being associated with rapid disease progression.

In this review, we focus on some of the key issues that are emerging now that CCR5 has been validated as a promising target for HIV prevention strategies and at a time when a CCR5 inhibitor has been approved in the United States as the first in a new class of anti-HIV therapeutic drugs.

Here, we report that multiple CXCR4-using variants of a parental CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate, SF162, obtained by either target cell selection or CCR5 inhibition have a common mutation pattern characterized by the same two V3 mutations and that these mutations preexisted in some of the SF162 stocks.

CCR5 may be the more suitable co-receptor target for small-molecule antagonists because a natural deletion in the CCR5 gene preventing its expression on the cell surface is not associated with any obvious phenotype, but can confer resistance to infection by CCR5-tropic strains-the most frequently sexually-transmitted strains.

The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by the inhibition of fusion by CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic (CXCR4 and CCR5) envelope glycoproteins from HIV-1 on CXCR4+ indicator cells, but the lack of effects by siRNAs targeting CXCR4 mRNA on dual-tropic HIV-1 envelopes in CCR5+ indicator cells utilizing these fusion assays.

This points to a different mechanism of CCR5 usage by these viruses and may have important implications for the development of HIV-1 inhibitors that target CCR5 coreceptor function.

The second extracellular loop (ECL2) domain of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been proposed as a specific target site for therapeutic agents aimed at blocking CCR5-dependent entry by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1).

Finally, we identified residues in the predicted CCR5 dimer interface that are mandatory for gp120 binding, suggesting that receptor dimerization might represent a target for new CCR5 entry inhibitors.

The current review enlightens the recent updates in the structural biology of the viral envelope and focuses on CCR5 as a validated target as well as ways to overcome CCR5 resistance.

CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, maraviroc, prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to CCR5 receptors.

Like SCH-C, vicriviroc binds specifically to the CCR5 receptor and prevents infection of target cells by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolates.

Furthermore, the same C1-expressing cells that were protected from R5 strain Ba-L retained susceptibility to X4 strain IIIB, which uses CXCR4 as the coreceptor instead of CCR5, suggesting that the RNase P-mediated cleavage induced by the EGS is specific for the target CCR5 but not the closely related CXCR4.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 acts as a co-receptor for HIV binding and it is considered as an important target by CCR5 antagonists.

Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from a CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donor was previously successful in eliminating HIV from the recipient\s immune system, suggesting that targeted CCR5 disruption can lead to an HIV cure.

The wealth of CCR5-related tools that have been developed during the intensive investigation of CCR5 as an HIV drug target can now be turned towards the study of CCR5 as a model chemokine receptor.

Finally, we discuss the potential of CCR5 as a drug target for diseases other than HIV, discussing the evidence linking CCR5 and its natural chemokine ligands with inflammatory diseases, particularly neuroinflammation, and certain cancers.

In this paper, we provide recent insights into the role of CCR5 and its ligands in metabolic syndrome as related to cardiovascular disease and the opportunities and roadblocks in targeting CCR5 and its ligands.

CCR5 is well known as a target for HIV therapy where its blockade is efficient and safe, it is also known that its mutation CCR5delta32 is for the most part non-pathological to its carriers.

The chemokine CCR5 receptor is target of maraviroc, a negative allosteric modulator of CCR5 that blocks the HIV protein gp120 from associating with the receptor, thereby inhibiting virus cellular entry.

Moreover, after short incubation and subsequent washout, a significant down-modulation of CCR5 was only seen with the fusion proteins and only on CD4+ cells, but not with unmodified RANTES or on CD4- cells, indicating a preferential targeting of CCR5 on CD4+ T cells.

Conversely, the transfer of CCR5(-/-) donor cells to nonirradiated recipients led to reduced infiltration of target organs, confirming previous studies and demonstrating that the role of CCR5 on donor T cells is dependent on conditioning of recipients.

These data clearly indicate that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM that are homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and, while the extent of alternative coreceptor use in SM with CCR5 wild type alleles is uncertain, strongly suggest that SIVsmm tropism and host cell targeting in vivo is defined by the distribution and use of alternative entry pathways in addition to CCR5.

SIVsmm entry through alternative pathways in vivo raises the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells and enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of extremely restricted CCR5 expression seen in SM and several other natural host species.

Although data from macaque studies suggest that CCR5+ CD4+ T cells are initial targets for HIV-1 infection, the impact of semen on T cell CCR5 expression and ligand production remains inconclusive.

As a first step toward achieving this goal, an HIV-1-susceptible cell-specific targeting vector was evaluated to selectively transfer, into CCR5-positive target cells, an anti-HIV CCR5 shRNA gene for subsequent knockdown of CCR5 expression and protection from HIV-1 infection.

These anti-CCR3 transgenes were compared to SFv-CCR5, an SFv against CCR5, and RNAi-R5, an RNAi that targets CCR5, for the ability to protect primary human brain microglia and MDM from infection with peripheral and neurotropic strains of HIV-1.

To better understand the functional role of CCR5 during leishmania infection, RNA interference strategy has been used to modulate macrophage function by targeting the expression of CCR5 gene.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CCR5 and CXCR3 in allergen-induced acute asthma and to determine whether a novel small-molecule compound, TAK-779 targeting CCR5 and CXCR3 can attenuate allergic airway responses.

Fullly major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched murine islet transplant models were used to test the in vivo effect of PNA CCR5 by targeting CCR5 in acute allograft rejection.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an attractive target for HIV-1 drug development, as individuals whose cells lack surface CCR5 expression are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection.

Although CCR5 might be a logical target for new drug development in HIV/AIDS, the benefits of blocking CCR5 could carry the cost of an increased risk of WNV disease in co-infected patients.

We conclude that CCR5 plays a key role in the mechanisms of host T cell and macrophage recruitment and allograft rejection, such that targeting of CCR5 clinically may be of therapeutic significance.

We conclude that the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is an ideal target site for the development of inhibitors of either chemokine or HIV-1 binding to CCR5.

Since HIV requires CD4 and a co-receptor, most commonly C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), for cellular entry targeting CCR5 expression is an attractive approach for therapy of HIV infection.

These findings imply that implementing a CCR5-Ig-based therapy would be advantageous over blockade of this receptor or of the use of mAbs for targeting a single CCR5 ligand.

MCC22 consists of mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist pharmacophores connected through a 22-atom spacer and was designed to target a putative MOR-CCR5 heteromer localized in pain processing areas.

In earlier studies we have shown that CCL5 activation of CCR5 induces the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells in a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner and that this is in part due to CCR5-mediated increases in glycolytic metabolism.

CCR5 is one of the receptors targeted by LukED and is the major coreceptor for CCR5-tropic HIV-1.

In summary, CCR5 regulates recruitment of blood leukocytes into the colon indicating that targeting CCR5 may offer therapeutic options in IBDs.

The efficacy of this approach relies on efficient biallelic disruption of CCR5, and the ability to efficiently target sequences that confer HIV resistance to the CCR5 locus has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes.

These findings indicate the importance of CKR-5 in HIV-1 transmission and suggest that targeting the HIV-1-CKR-5 interaction may provide a means of preventing or slowing disease progression.

Since antiviral agents preventing CCR5 utilization by the virus are already in use, while others targeting either CCR5 or CXCR4 (or both) are under investigation, understanding the biological correlates of this " asymmetrical" utilization of HIV entry co-receptors bears relevance for the clinical choice of which therapeutics should be administered to infected individuals.

To directly measure how KLF2 affects CCR5 regulation, we introduced small interfering RNA targeting KLF2 expression and demonstrated that reduced KLF2 expression also resulted in less CCR5.

These results indicate that (i) AGMs are readily infected with SIVagm by both intrarectal and intravaginal routes, (ii) susceptibility to infection is proportional to the number of available CCR5(+) CD4(+) target cells in the mucosa, and (iii) the paucity of CCR5(+) CD4(+) target cells in infant and juvenile AGMs may explain the near absence of vertical transmission.

Our estimate of the threshold surface density of gp120-CCR5 complexes necessary for HIV-1 entry thus appears robust and may have implications for optimizing treatment with coreceptor antagonists, understanding the non-pathogenic infection of non-human primates, and designing vaccines that suppress the availability of target CD4(+) CCR5(+) cells.

However, the R5X4 intermediate virus entered CCR5-expressing target cells less efficiently than the parental R5 strain and was more sensitive to both CCR5 and CXCR4 inhibitors than either the parental R5 or the final X4 virus.

Characterizing the link between the function and dynamics of CCR5 populations has implications for understanding their selective targeting by HIV-1 and for the development of inhibitors that will block CCR5 utilization by the virus.

CCR5 is a reasonable but not absolutely protective target for a cure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, because CCR5-null blood cells are largely resistant to HIV-1 entry.

C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is the main co-receptor for HIV entry into the target CD4+ cells, and homozygous CCR5Δ32/Δ32 cells are resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV infection.

In previous studies we demonstrated the utility of an anti-CCR5 ribozyme targeted to a single cleavage site in downregulating CCR5 expression and consequently providing resistance to viral infection.

To improve on the level of downregulation we designed a construct containing an anti-CCR5 ribozyme heterotrimer (R5RbzTM) targeted to three different cleavage sites in CCR5 mRNA.

Polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene that reduce CCR5 expression levels, protect against disease progression, suggesting that drugs targeted to CCR5 could be effective.

Mutated envelopes with some preservation of entry function on either CCR5- or CXCR4-expressing target cells were further characterized for their sensitivity to CCR5 or CXCR4 inhibitors, soluble CD4, and the neutralizing antibodies b12-IgG and 40000000000.0.

In view of CCR5\s importance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HIV, this observation provides novel insight into the β-arrestin/CCR5 pathway.

As proof-of-concept, since CCR5 is considered a major silencing target of HIV therapy, CCR5-siRNA nanocapsules were delivered into 293 T cells and successfully downregulated the CCR5 RNA fused with mCherry reporter RNA.

Our findings suggest that targeting CCR2/CCR5 should provide greater efficacy than targeting CCR2 or CCR5 alone, and that dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist RAP-103 has the potential for broad clinical use in neuropathic pain treatment.

Clonal analysis of viral isolates from a limited number of patients revealed that these CXCR4-tropic strains did not develop by mutation of a CCR5-tropic virus during therapy, but emerged from a minor population of CXCR4-tropic variants already present in the patients at baseline.

To trace the evolutionary patterns underlying evolution of coreceptor use within a host, we studied an HIV-1 transmission pair involving a donor who exclusively harbored CCR5-using (R5) variants throughout his entire disease course and a recipient who developed CXCR4-using variants.

A homology model of CCR5 was developed based on the recently reported CXCR4 structure as template.

AIDS-associated, CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 clones, isolated from a patient that never developed CXCR4-tropic HIV-1, replicate to a greater extent and cause greater cytopathic effects than R5 HIV-1 clones isolated before the onset of AIDS.

The study shows that implication of peptide carriers modified with CXCR4 ligand is a promising approach to develop targeted siRNA delivery system into CXCR4-expressing cancer and endothelial cells.

In an effort to develop imaging probes for CXCR4, we developed a novel small molecule CXCR4-targeted PET agent (compound 5) by combining our established benzenesulfonamide scaffold with a labeling component by virtue of click chemistry.

The positive expression rate of CXCR4 and MMP-2 was 68.5 % and 54.8 % respectively, and of the 45 patients who developed distal metastasis, 33 and 28 patients had positive expression of CXCR4 and MMP-2 respectively.

To quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in cell-based assays and living mouse models of ovarian cancer, we developed a click beetle red luciferase complementation reporter that detects activation of CXCR4 based on recruitment of the cytosolic adapter protein β-arrestin 2.

An 111 In-labeled CXCR4 antagonist peptide, 111 In-Ac-TZ14011, has been developed for SPECT imaging of CXCR4 expression in xenograft tumors in mice (9).

Here, for the first time, AMD3100 (AMD), a CXCR4-receptor antagonist, was coformulated with sulfotanshinone IIA sodium (STS IIA) into a liposome (STS-AMD-Lips) to develop a CXCR4 receptor targeting form of combination therapy for PF.

We developed a novel CXCR4-targeted near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (Peptide R-NIR750) conjugating the new developed CXCR4 peptidic antagonist Peptide R with the NIR fluorescent dye VivoTag-S750.

An indium (111 In)-labeled CXCR4 antagonist, [ 111 In]-Ac-TZ14011, was developed for the imaging of CXCR4 expression in xenograft tumors in mice, and Hanaoka et al.

This receptor seems to be very important in disease transmission, whereas CXCR4 receptor tends to be used by the viral strains that emerge later in the disease in addition to or instead of the CCR5.

In 50 % of progressing HIV-1 patients, CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus emerges late in infection, often overtaking CCR5-tropic (R5) virus as the dominant viral strain.

Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR4-using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR4-using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR5-tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc.

CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated.

" Recent discoveries have determined that macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 which are largely responsible for sexual transmission require the beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 in addition to CD4, while the T cell tropic viruses that emerge later after infection use the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4.

Inferring an evolutionary tree from the 1674 unique reads that span the V3 region confirms that the CXCR4-using population emerged from low-frequency CXCR4-using variants present before treatment.

We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months.

Taken together, CXCR4-using variants at late-stage infection are likely to emerge when replication-competent CXCR4-using variants are maintained as a minor population during the course of infection.

In this study, we used sequential primary isolates and recombinant strains of HIV-1 to demonstrate that CXCR4-using (X4) viruses emerging in association with disease progression are highly pathogenic in ex vivo lymphoid tissues compared to CXCR4-independent viruses.

But emergence of CXCR4-tropic viruses on therapy may require a critical threshold of CXCR4 viral load at baseline, which may not be the case in patients with a very low proportion of CXCR4-using variants.

However, changes at specific V3 positions were prerequisite for persistence of CXCR4-using variants in vivo, suggesting that positive selection targeting the V3 loop is required for emergence of CXCR4-using variants during natural disease course.

In contrast, basic amino acid substitutions at position 25, or substitutions at positions 6-8 resulting in the loss of a potential N-linked glycosylation site, contributed to CXCR4-mediated entry but required additional substitutions acting cooperatively to confer efficient CXCR4 use.

We found that the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of CXCR4 and specifically phosphorylation of Ser-339 within this region were required for TCR-CXCR4 complex formation.

These data suggest that the interaction of gp120 with CD4 or CXCR4 is required for efficient inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, although in the presence of CXCR4 the interaction of gp120 with CD4 may be dispensable.

Our results indicate that Cxcr4a is required for Hh-dependent cell proliferation but not for Hh-dependent patterning, and suggest that the parallel activation of Cxcr4a is required to modulate the Hh pathway to distinguish between patterning and proliferation.

Using S1P5(-/-) mice and a new knockin mouse model in which CXCR4 cannot be desensitized (a mouse model of warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis [ WHIM] syndrome), we demonstrate that NK-cell exit from the BM requires both CXCR4 desensitization and S1P5 engagement.

Taken together, we demonstrated that CXCR4 plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis required for OSCC progression, whereas TAITN induced by CXCR4 antagonism could be an effective anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategy in OSCC treatment.

Notably, chemotaxis toward both proteins is CXCR4-dependent but, in contrast to fr-HMGB1, 3 S does not require CXCL12 since hcFbs migration persists in the presence of the CXCL12/CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or an anti-CXCL12 antibody.

Thus, SIVmac239 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4 with high efficiency, but the changes required for this phenotype may be distinct from those for HIV-1 CXCR4 use.

Using CXCR4 chimeras and mutants, we determined that SDF-1 requires the CXCR4 amino terminus for binding and activates downstream signaling pathways by interacting with the second extracellular loop of CXCR4.

SDF-1-mediated activation of CXCR4 required the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif in the second intracellular loop of CXCR4, was pertussis toxin sensitive, and did not require the distal C-terminal tail of CXCR4.

In addition, while the V4 or the V5 region of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 failed to confer the capacity to utilize CXCR4 on HIV-1(AD8), these regions were required in conjunction with regions V1 to V3 of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 for efficient utilization of CXCR4.

Using mink lung epithelial cells expressing CXCR4 and a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of CXCR4, we found that an intact cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain was required for both PMA and ligand-induced CXCR4 endocytosis.

- APE strongly induced expression and function of CXCR4 and reduced CCR1 and CCR5 expression on immature DCs.

Mutagenesis studies of Env amino acid variants influencing coreceptor usage showed that S306 in the gp120 V3 region of brain-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CCR5 N terminus and enhances CCR5 usage for HIV-1 entry into PBMC and MDM, whereas R306 in spleen-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CXCR4 N terminus and confers the CXCR4 restricted phenotype.

As expected, CCR5 antagonists do not reduce viral load in patients harbouring CXCR4-tropic or dual/mixed tropic viruses.

Additionally, CCR5 antagonists may not reduce the HIV-1 RNA load when mixed/dual-tropic or CXCR4-using virus is present.

Treatment of the target cells with these agents did not change the levels of CD4 or CXCR4, but reduced levels of CCR5 on the cell surface.

Through the use of chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 receptors we have previously shown that CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 isolates acquire a more flexible receptor use over time, and that this links to a reduced viral susceptibility to inhibition by the CCR5 ligand RANTES.

Moreover, the lasting predominating CCR5-tropism during periods of full viral control suggests the involvement of cellular mechanisms that preferentially reduce CXCR4-tropic viruses during cART.

We also found that mutations at C-terminus of CCR5 reduced its ability to form heterodimers with CXCR4.

DT-13 significantly decreased the gene expression of CCR5 in both BGC-823 and HGC-27 gastric cancer cells, and moderately reduced the expression of CXCR4.

After 3 days CCR5 expression was reduced both in CD4+ and in CD8+ T lymphocytes, while CXCR4 expression was not, coincident with initiation of HIV replication in culture.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CCR2-V64I heterozygotes had normal levels of CCR2b and CCR5 but slightly reduced levels of CXCR4.

The use of CCR5 inhibitors as a second-line treatment increases the possibility that these reagents will select for more pathogenic CXCR4-using variants.

CXCR4 expression on lymphocytes from septic patients was increased whereas CCR5 was decreased and CCR7 was unchanged.

Drugs of abuse may promote HIV replication by increasing the expression of CCR5 receptors, decreasing the expression of CCR5 receptor ligands increasing the expression of CXCR4 receptors, increasing the expression of DC-SIGN, and possibly inducing epigenetic changes.

Our results showed that IL-1 increased CXCR4 expression whereas TNF-alpha increased CX3CR1, CCR9 and CCR5.

In fact, we found that CXCR4 remained high in monocyte-macrophage cells throughout infection and its expression was increased in T-lymphocytes in Group II patients as opposed to CCR5 behavior in BALf which significantly decreases.

However, after 3 months of combined anti-retroviral regimen, expression of CXCR4 significantly increased while CCR5 decreased when compared with pretherapy determinations.

We hypothesized: (i) that the early dominance of CCR5-tropic viruses results from faster turnover rates of CCR5(+) cells, and (ii) that X4-tropic strains exert greater pathogenicity by preferentially increasing turnover rates within the CXCR4(+) compartment.

Sequence comparisons indicate that X4 virus can be selected in vivo due to either absence of CCR5 receptors or relative increase of CXCR4 receptors.

Some degree of resistance with continued CCR5 use is possible if viruses develop an increased affinity for unbound CCR5 molecules, characterized phenotypically by a classic shift in the 50 % inhibitory concentration.

Recently, CCR5 antagonists have been developed that obstruct binding of CCR5 by gp120, thus inhibiting host cell entry.

CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), and efforts have been made to develop ligands to inhibit HIV-1 infection by promoting CCR5 receptor endocytosis.

IMPORTANCE It is believed that each CCR5 antagonist-resistant isolate will develop its own unique set of mutations, making it difficult to identify a signature mutation that can effectively predict CCR5 antagonist resistance.

In this review we first describe the advantages and limitations of the currently available strategies for HIV prevention, then we focus on strategies targeting CCR5, covering the progress that has been made in developing different classes of CCR5 inhibitors for prophylaxis, and the perspectives for their future development as new weapons in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.

Recent studies have shown additional unique features of certain CCR5 inhibitors such as immunomodulating properties and HIV-1 latency reversal properties, and thus, continuous efforts in developing new CCR5 inhibitors with unique binding profiles is necessary.

Approximately 70 % to 85 % of wild-type and CCR5+/- mice infected with PbA developed CM, whereas only about 20 % of PbA-infected CCR5-deficient mice exhibited the characteristic neurologic signs of CM.

Moreover, experiments using bone marrow (BM)-chimeric mice showed that a reduced but significant proportion of deficient mice grafted with CCR5+ BM develop CM, indicating that CCR5 expression on a radiation-resistant brain cell population is necessary for CM to occur.

CCR5 developed high-titer anti-CCR5 antibody responses.

However, exacerbated arthritis was not intrinsic to the CCR5(-/-) lymphoid cells, because the arthritis that developed in SCID mouse recipients was similar to that in WT and CCR5(-/-) mice.

In order to study the distribution of CCR5, we developed a series of monoclonal antibodies against human CCR5.

To understand the molecular basis of the binding of chemokines and HIV-1 to CCR5, we developed a number of mAbs that inhibit the various interactions of CCR5, and mapped the binding sites of these mAbs using a panel of CCR5/CCR2b chimeras.

These findings suggest that CCR5(-/-) mice developed less cartilage degeneration, which may indicate a potential protective role of CCR5-ablation in cartilage homeostasis.

The CCR5 antagonists maraviroc or vicriviroc developed to block CCR5 HIV coreceptor function, reduced in vitro invasion of basal breast cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation or viability, and maraviroc decreased pulmonary metastasis in a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer.

Through NMR and SPR experiments, we show a 19-residue TYSN-containing peptide to be a functional, hydrolytically stable CCR5 Nt isostere that was in turn used to develop both SPR-based and ELISA assays to screen for inhibitors of CCR5 binding to gp120-CD4.

Understanding transmission and control of HIV-1 in persons homozygous for CCR5(Δ32) is important given efforts to develop HIV-1 curative therapies aimed at modifying or disrupting CCR5 expression.

The viral resistance of marketed antiviral drugs including the emergence of new viral resistance of the only marketed CCR5 entry inhibitor, maraviroc, makes it necessary to develop new CCR5 allosteric inhibitors.

Our results show that efficient CCR5-mediated MDM entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses is associated with increased tolerance of several mutations within the CCR5 N terminus.

We found an abrupt decline in the ability of viruses to use CCR5 for entry at this time, manifested by a 1-to 2-log increase in susceptibility to CCR5 inhibitors and a reduced ability to infect cell lines with low CCR5 expression.

CCL3 transport occurred independently of the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, albeit that migrated cells displayed increased expression of CCR1 and CCR5.

The CCL5 activation of PC cells expressing CCR5 increased their invasive potential, while treatment with CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc inhibited the CCL5 activation.

In this context, the C-C chemokine ligand 5/C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCL5/CCR5) axis is gained increasing attention, since abnormal expression and activity of CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 have been found in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

In this context, the C-C chemokine ligand 5/C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCL5/CCR5) axis is gaining increasing attention, since abnormal expression and activity of CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 have been found in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

The validation experiments showed that those variants in CCR5 and C3AR1 significantly increased the rise of intracellular calcium and the variant in CCR5 profoundly enhanced proliferative capacity of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.

The gene expression levels of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and Artemin and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) were augmented by inflammatory cytokines, while chemokines increased only CCR5 gene expression.

Both CCR5 and CCR2 expression were increased in AD patients respect to control subjects and the expression of CCR2 and CCR5 was more frequent on CD4+ and less frequent on CD8+ cells.

CCR5(-/-) (H-2(b)) recipients of A/J (H-2(a)) cardiac allografts had equivalent numbers of donor-reactive CD4 T cells producing IFN-gamma, whereas CD4 T cells producing IL-4 were increased in CCR5(-/-) recipients.

It is concluded that the knock-out of CCR5 on donor cells results in increase of GVHD and donor CD8(+) T cell expansion, as well as hepatic and renal lesions in allo-HSCT, which indicates that CCR5 is very important in allo-BMT.

Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WNV-infected CCR5+/+ mice into infected CCR5-/- mice increased leukocyte accumulation in the CNS compared with transfer of splenocytes from infected CCR5-/- mice into infected CCR5-/- mice, and increased survival to 60 %, the same as in infected CCR5+/+ control mice.

The increased prevalence of CCR5-Delta32 homozygosity associated with increased viral loads in patients with chronic hepatitis C suggests that the CCR5-Delta32 mutation may be an adverse host factor in hepatitis C.

Significant differences in relative content of Th and CTL carrying CCR5 and CCR6 were not detected despite a non-significant increase of quantity of CCR5+ and CCR6+ Th.

Expression of Th1-associated CCR5 was down-regulated following antigen challenge, together with an increased CCR4/CCR5 ratio and CCL2 secretion in GAD-alum-treated patients, but not in the placebo group.

CCR5(-/-) mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5(+/+) mice.

Here, we studied the mechanisms of CCR5 upregulation and increased immunosuppressive function of CCR5+ MDSC.

CCR5 ligand, gene and protein expression of CCR5, and surface expression of CCR5 significantly increased in blood and tumor of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting MDSC may be attracted into the parenchyma by CCL5/CCR5.

Instead, adoptive transfer of CCR5(+) CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs into Ccr5(-/-) mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the spleen and brain, and transferred CCR5(+) Tregs were found to produce IL-10.

Furthermore, CCR5 blockade promoted PPARγ activation, and the increased numbers of M2 macrophages induced by CCR5 blockade were both reversed with additional PPARγ antagonist treatment.

An elevated intestinal CCL3 expression 1 week after allo-BMT was associated with an increased expression of CCR5 but not CCR1 or CCR3, and in the lung and liver CCL3-CCL5 expression was associated with increases in CCR1 and CCR5.

In addition, we provided evidence that upregulation of SOD-1 by CCL5/CCR5 activation occurred in parallel with the increased release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide and production of intracellular reactive oxygen species as well as enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activity in CCR5-positive RAW264.

CCR1 blockade in CCR5(-/-) mice significantly reduced renal chemokine expression, T cell infiltration, and glomerular crescent formation, indicating that increased renal leukocyte recruitment and consecutive tissue damage in nephritic CCR5(-/-) mice depended on functional CCR1.

CCR5 expression at different time points of infection revealed increased expression at protein and mRNA level from 3 to 24 h and beyond 24 h expression of CCR5 is downregulated.

In CCR5 knockout (KO) mice, these CS-induced increases in CCR5 ligands, inflammatory cells in BAL and peribronchial lymphoid follicles were all significantly attenuated compared with wild-type animals.

However, CCR5 deficiency did not affect CS-induced airway wall remodelling, because chronic CS exposure induced a similar increase in airway wall thickness, smooth muscle mass and peribronchial deposition of collagen and fibronectin in both wild-type and CCR5 KO mice.

We show that in contrast to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, CCR5-/- CD4+CD25+ nTreg cells resulted in an increased magnitude of parasite-specific, interferon gamma-producing CD4+ T cells within infection sites, dramatically reduced parasite numbers, and potent resistance to infection, a finding consistent with the clinical outcome of infected CCR5-/- mice.

In conclusion, lack of the chemokine receptor CCR5 exacerbates experimental cerulein-induced AP and leads to increased levels of CC chemokines and a more pronounced pancreatic inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of AP.

Serum levels of CCR5 ligands and their hepatic transcript levels were significantly increased after Con A injection, whereas CCR5+ liver mononuclear cells were recruited to the liver.

In conclusion, CCR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis, and leads to increased levels of CCR5 ligands and a more pronounced liver mononuclear infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of immuno-mediated liver injury.

An array of 23 H/M-CCR5 hybrids containing increasing amounts of H-CCR5 extending from the N terminus generated by random chimeragenesis had a biphasic pattern of coreceptor activity with JRFL and 89.6, revealing active regions in the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ED) and at the junction of cytoplasmic loop 3.

In addition, CCR5-deficient mice had an enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and increased humoral responses to T cell-dependent antigenic challenge, indicating a novel role of CCR5 in down-modulating T cell-dependent immune response.

This mAb was a genuine antagonist of CCR5, since it failed to stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the CCR5 transfectants, but blocked calcium responses elicited by RANTES, MIP-1alpha, or MIP-1beta.

Surprisingly, CCR5 restoration in the BM alone was not sufficient to rescue the wild type phenotype, suggesting that impaired tumor growth associated with inhibiting CCL5/CCR5 is not due to defects in EPC biology.

Furthermore, AMD3100 and maraviroc, antagonists of CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors, respectively inhibit the effect of gp120Bal on NR1, suggesting that CXCR4 and CCR5 activation are involved.

A tyrosine-sulfated CCR5-mimetic peptide, CCR5mim1 inhibits HIV-1 infection more efficiently than sulfopeptides based on the CCR5 amino terminus.

Using a panel of synthetic CCR5 ECL2-derived peptides, we show that the C-terminal portion of ECL2 (2 C, comprising amino acids Cys-178 to Lys-191) inhibit HIV-1 entry of both CCR5- and CXCR4-using isolates at low micromolar concentrations.

A monoclonal CCR5 antibody, PRO 140 (a humanised form of the PA14 antibody)  inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1.

Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4.

Thereby, the 30-oxo-calenduladiol-associated anti-HIV-1 activity against R5-tropic virus appears to rely on the selective occupancy of the CCR5 receptor to inhibit CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 provides an entry portal for HIV-1, and PRO 140 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CCR5 and potently inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 in vitro.

CCR5 receptors on HL cell lines were functionally active, since neutralizing anti-CCL5 monoclonal antibodies inhibited basal proliferation of HL-derived cell lines and recombinant CCR5 ligands (CCL3/Mip-1 alpha, CCL4/Mip1 beta and CCL5/Rantes) increased their clonogenic growth.

The CCR5 co-receptor antagonists inhibit fusion of HIV with the host cell by blocking the interaction between the gp-120 viral glycoprotein and the CCR5 chemokine receptor.

PRO 140 is a humanized mAb that binds to the CCR5 coreceptor and inhibits CCR5-tropic HIV-1 by interfering with viral entry.

PRO 140 (a humanized form of the PA14 antibody, a monoclonal CCR5 antibody) inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry by altering the CCR5 extracellular loops (ECL), such that the gp120 envelope glycoproteins (Env) no longer recognize CCR5.

More in depth in vitro studies have shown that editing the CCR5 locus was able to inhibit infection from CCR5-utilizing virus, but CXCR4-utilizing virus was still able to infect cells.

Entry inhibitors, such as Maraviroc, bind to CCR5 inhibiting entry of CCR5 utilizing viruses (R5 viruses).

With regard to the latter, peptides derived from the HIV coreceptor CCR5 were previously shown to modestly inhibit entry of CCR5-tropic HIV strains, with a peptide containing residues 178-191 of the second extracellular loop (peptide 2 C) showing the strongest inhibition.

Finally, when CCR5 genetic polymorphism data were integrated with results from the in vitro LC infection studies, PSC-RANTES was found to be equally effective in inhibiting R5 HIV in LC isolated from individuals with CCR5 diplotypes known to be associated with low, intermediate, and high cell surface levels of CCR5.

Here, we demonstrate that a tyrosine sulfated peptide, reproducing the entire N-terminal extracellular region of CCR5, its unsulfated analogue, and a point-mutated peptide are unable to inhibit R5-HIV-1 mediated infection, competing with the entire CCR5 in the formation of gp120-CD4-CCR5 complex.

We propose that the binding of small molecules to the transmembrane domain of CCR5 may disrupt the conformation of its extracellular domain, thereby inhibiting ligand binding to CCR5.

In conclusion, interference with CCR5 may efficiently inhibit the replication of at least some dualtropic HIV-1 strains, whereas forced CXCR4 usage may result in viral escape from CCR5-dependent inhibitory effects.

Here we demonstrate that a tyrosine-sulfated peptide based on the N terminus of CCR5, but not its unsulfated analogue inhibits infection of macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by CCR5-dependent, but not CXCR4-dependent, HIV-1 isolates.

However, CD4+ mature thymocytes were productively infected with the CCR5-tropic strain Ba-L, and this infection was specifically inhibited with the CCR5 agonist, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta.

The entry of SIVmac239, which uses the same coreceptors (CD4/CCR5) as HIV-1, was not inhibited by FP-21399, indicating that the antiviral effect of FP-21399 is specific for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and is not dependent upon the cellular receptors CD4 and CCR5.

The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist, maraviroc, concentration-dependently inhibited gp120-induced tumour necrosis factor-α gene expression, indicating that these effects occurred via gp120 activation of CCR5.

Quantitative microscopy of 2 G12 binding and dissociation from single virions and studies using a split CCR5 coreceptor suggest that 2 G12 competitively inhibits interactions between gp120\s V3 loop and the tyrosine sulfate-containing CCR5 amino terminus, thereby reducing assembly of complexes that catalyze entry.

DAPTA, a HIV gp120-derived CCR5 entry inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit CCR5-mediated monocyte migration and to attenuate neuroinflammation.

The BSCI termed Peptide 3 strongly inhibited CCR5 mediated HIV infection of THP-1 cells (83 +/- 7 % inhibition assayed by immunofluoresence staining), but had no effect on gp120 binding to CCR5.

All CCR5 models had equally good geometry, but that built from the recently reported dimeric structure of the other HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 bound to the peptide CVX15 (Protein Data Bank code 3 OE0) best agreed with the SDM data and discriminated CCR5 from non-CCR5 binders in a virtual screening approach.

SDM and automated docking predicted that maraviroc inserts deeply in CCR5 transmembrane cavity where it can occupy three different binding sites, whereas CCL3 and gp120 lie on distinct yet overlapped regions of the CCR5 extracellular loop 2.

While the lack of structural information on CCR5 has hampered the rational design of specific inhibitors, mimetics of the chemokines that naturally bind CCR5 can be molecularly engineered.

Compound 14 (2-isobutyl-N-({[N-methyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl) amino]methyl}phenyl)-1-oxo-23-dihydro-1H-2-benzazepine-4-carboxamide) activates the CCR5 receptor in a CCL4-dependent manner, but does not compete with [ 3 H]TAK-779 binding at the CCR5.

The small molecule metal ion chelators bipyridine and terpyridine complexed with Zn2+ (ZnBip and ZnTerp) act as CCR5 agonists and strong positive allosteric modulators of CCL3 binding to CCR5, weak modulators of CCL4 binding, and competitors for CCL5 binding.

We describe the use of two CCR5 antagonists, Schering-C (SCH-C), which is specific for CCR5, and TAK-779, a dual inhibitor of CCR5 and CCR2b, to probe the CCR5 inhibitor binding site using CCR5/CCR2b chimeric receptors.

Here, we present a 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of CCR5 bound to PF-232798, a second-generation oral CCR5 antagonist currently in phase II clinical trials.

CCL4, a CC chemokine, previously known as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 β, has diverse effects on various types of immune and nonimmune cells by the virtue of its interaction with its specific receptor, CCR5, in collaboration with related but distinct CC chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL5, which can also bind CCR5.

For example, compounds that prevent CD4 or CCR5 binding have been demonstrated recently to prevent vaginal transmission in rhesus macaques, but the expression and distribution of CCR5 has not been examined in the macaque vagina.

With the use of a series of complementary techniques to measure CCR5 expression (antibody labeling, Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), we established that intracellular pools of CCR5 do not exist and that the results obtained by the other researchers were false-positives that arose because of the generation of irrelevant binding sites for anti-CCR5 antibodies during fixation and permeabilization of cells.

CCR5 antagonists block HIV cell entry through competitive binding to the CCR5 receptor present on the surface of CD4(+) cells.

Here, we show that rhesus cDDR5 (rcDDR5)-specific antibodies react with not only cell-expressed but also virion-incorporated simian CCR5s (siCCR5s), but may predominantly exert their inhibitory effects on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by the binding of cell-expressed rather than virion-incorporated CCR5s.

These results suggest that the virion-incorporated CCR5 may contribute to the reactivation of the anti-rcDDR5 antibody-producing B-cells by SIV particles after rcDDR5 immunization, although the binding of anti-rcDDR5 antibody to virion-incorporated CCR5 results in a partial inhibitory effect on SIV infection.

A panel of synthetic peptides spanning the CCR5-ECL1 region and displaying glycine or alanine substitutions was assayed for antibody binding with a pool of natural anti-CCR5 antibodies.

In molecular docking studies of YM-370749 and a three-dimensional model of CCR5 based on the rhodopsin crystal structure as well as binding and functional studies using various CCR5 mutants, the amino acid residues necessary for interaction with YM-370749 were marked.

Epidermal but not intramuscular delivery of the CCR5 gene to mice elicited strong IgG antibody binding responses to CCR5.

Thus reactivity of antibodies raised to CCR5 against phage-displayed peptides defined mimotopes that reflect binding sites for these antibodies and reveal a part of the gp120 binding sites on CCR5.

The 2 D7 binding site mapped to the second extracellular loop of CCR5, whereas a group of mAbs that failed to block chemokine binding all mapped to the NH2-terminal region of CCR5.

To further understand how different envelope molecules use CCR5 as an entry cofactor, we show that soluble purified envelope glycoproteins (SU component) from CCR5-tropic HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV can compete for binding of iodinated chemokine to CCR5.

Soluble CD4 was found to potentiate binding of the HIV-2 ST and SIVmac239 envelope glycoproteins to CCR5, suggesting that a CD4-induced conformational change in SU is required for subsequent binding to CCR5.

Initial studies in mice identified a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal domain of pig-tailed macaque CCR5 fused to streptavidin that, when conjugated at high density to bovine papillomavirus major capsid protein L1 VLPs, induced high-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) that bound to a macaque CCR5-expressing cell line in vitro.

We previously reported that F4/80(-) B220(-) CD11c(+) DC precursors expressing the CC chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 are mobilized rapidly into the circulation in mice injected with Propionibacterium acnes and are recruited into inflammatory tissue by macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha), which binds to CCR1 and CCR5.

Experiments involving peptide pretreatment and washing, modulation of the expression levels of Env and CCR5, analysis of CCR5 peptide effects against different coreceptors, and inhibition of radiolabeled glycoprotein (gp) 120 binding to CCR5 suggested that the peptide-blocking activities reflect their interactions with gp120.

We show in this study that a 30-aa-based CCR5-Ig fusion protein encoding the second extracellular domain of receptor selectively binds and neutralizes all three CCR5 ligands and, when administered during ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rapidly suppressed the disease while arresting Ag-specific effector T cell functions.

These vaccines induce anti-CCR5 antibodies that bind to native CCR5 and inhibit SIV infection in vitro.

Targeting CCR5/CCR5 ligand signaling via a fusion protein mCCR5-Ig, which selectively binds and neutralizes all three CCR5 ligands, increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Using binding assays, we further determined that recombinant CCR5-T4L and [ 125 I]-CCL5 compete for the same binding site on wild type CCR5.

Expression of UL33 and UL78 had pleiotropic, predominantly negative, effects on CCR5 and CXCR4 cell surface expression, ligand-induced internalization, signal transduction, and migration without modifying the chemokine binding properties of CCR5 and CXCR4.

As the CCR5 N terminus-gp120 interactions are dependent on CD4 activation, our data suggest that gp120 has separate binding sites for the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2, the ECL2 binding site is present prior to CD4 engagement, and it is conserved across CCR5- and CXCR4-using strains.

Maraviroc (MVC) and other CCR5 antagonists are HIV-1 entry inhibitors that bind to- and alter the conformation of CCR5, such that CCR5 is no longer recognized by the viral gp120 envelope (Env) glycoproteins.

CCR5 binding and HIV-1 infection inhibition experiments suggest that the two CCR5 inhibitor-resistant viruses altered their interactions with CCR5 in different ways.

TAK779 and maraviroc (MVC), inhibit CCL3 and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 binding to CCR5 by a noncompetitive and allosteric mechanism, supporting the view that they bind to regions of CCR5 distinct from the gp120- and CCL3-binding sites.

Dissociation of [ (125) I]CCL3 from CCR5 was accelerated by TAK779, to a lesser extent by MVC, and by GTP analogs, suggesting that inverse agonism contributes to allosteric inhibition of the chemokine binding to CCR5.

This suggests that allosteric CCR5 inhibitors not only act by blocking gp120 binding but also alter distinct steps of CCR5 usage in the course of HIV infection.

CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5, one of the second receptors of HIV-1, and inhibit HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells.

In contrast, TA1 interacted with CCR5 less efficiently and was highly sensitive to antibodies that bind to the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2.

To present recent information on the evolution of coreceptor use from CCR5 alone to CCR5 and CXCR4, the impact CCR5 inhibitors have on this process, and new insights into HIV-1 binding to CD4 and CCR5.

Genetic polymorphisms in humans that affect CCR5 or chemokines that bind CCR5 affect not only virus entry but also immune reconstitution.

Maraviroc is a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist that blocks HIV binding to the CCR5 receptor, which is a CD4 co-receptor necessary for cell entry.

Recombinant gp120 proteins from two HIV-1 subtype B clones bound CCR5 in the presence of CD4, while gp120 from the X4-tropic, HxB2, clone did not bind CCR5.

The small molecule NBD-556 mimics CD4 by binding the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein, moderately inhibiting virus entry into CD4-expressing target cells and enhancing CCR5 binding and virus entry into CCR5-expressing cells lacking CD4.

The results obtained for CCR5 suggest the possibility that different active scaffolds bind in different ways within the CCR5 pocket.

CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5 to prevent viral entry.

HIV resistance to CCR5 antagonists occurs either through outgrowth of pre-existing CXCR4-using viruses, or through acquisition of the ability of CCR5-using HIV-1 to use the antagonist bound form of CCR5.

In addition, CCR5 binding by FLSC IgG1, but not CCR5 Ab 2 D7, was significantly increased when cells were treated with MVC, suggesting MVC allosterically increases exposure of the FLSC IgG1 binding site.

The cell surface receptors CD4 and CCR5 bind CCR5-tropic HIV Envelope (Env) glycoprotein during virus attachment.

However, we showed here that different CCR5 conformations at the cell surface are differentially engaged by chemokines and gp120, making chemokines weaker inhibitors of HIV infection than would be expected from their binding affinity constants for CCR5.

Whereas native CCR5 chemokines bind with subnanomolar affinity to (NF) G protein-coupled CCR5, gp120/HIV-1 does not discriminate between (NF) G protein-coupled and uncoupled CCR5.

Abolishing CCR5 interaction with (NF) G proteins eliminates high-affinity binding of CCR5 chemokines but preserves receptor endocytosis, indicating that chemokines preferentially endocytose low-affinity receptors.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist binds to CCR5 receptor.

From a functional standpoint, we illustrate that the nature of the CCR5 molecules to which gp120/HIV-1 binds shapes sensitivity to inhibition by CCR5 ligands and cellular tropism.

In order to evaluate if these cells are infectabile by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and could be employed as a model in HIV research we exposed these cell lines to X4 (T-cell tropic) and R5 (macrophage tropic) and subsequently tried to correlate their infectability with (i) level of chemokine coreceptor (CXCR4 and CCR5) expression, (ii) coreceptor functionality (calcium flux, chemotaxis and phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44 and AKT) and (iii) endogenous expression and secretion of HIV-related chemokines which compete with the virus for binding to CXCR4 (SDF-1/CXCL12) or CCR5 (MIP-1beta/CCL4, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7 and MCP-4/CCL13).

These included derivatives of a CCR5 ligand, RANTES, with modified N-termini as well as Kaposi\s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded chemokines that bind a wide range of co-receptors, including CCR5, CXCR4, CCR3 and CCR8, as well as the orphan 7 TM receptors GPR1 and STRL33.

We hypothesized that CD34(+) cells secrete CCR5-binding chemokines and that these factors interfere with HIV R5 interactions with these cells, possibly by binding CCR5 or by inducing its internalization.

Substitution of the 8 x V3 loop with that from the R5 virus strain BaL resulted in an Env (8 x-V3BaL) that mediated CD4-independent CCR5-dependent virus infection and a gp120 that bound to CCR5 in the absence of CD4.

The best juice was tested for inhibition of: (1) infection by HIV-1 BaL, utilizing CCR5 as the cellular coreceptor, and (2) binding of gp120 IIIB and gp120 BaL, respectively, to CXCR4 and CCR5.

We predicted the structural basis for pleiotropic signaling of the C-C chemokine type 5 (CCR5) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) by predicting the binding of several ligands to the lower-energy conformations of the CCR5 receptor and 11 mutants.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist blocking coreceptor binding during HIV entry, is active in vitro against CCR5-tropic HIV-2 but more studies are needed to validate its use in therapeutic treatments against HIV-2 infection.

MVC significantly reduced macrophage inflammatory protein 1 β-induced CCR5 internalization in rectal mononuclear cells, an indication of efficient binding to CCR5 in rectal lymphocytes.

Unlike human CCR5 chemokine ligands which induce rapid CCR5 internalization mediated via clathrin, treatment with U83A prevents internalization.

Indeed, the CCR5 agonists described herein were found to induce profound down-modulation of CCR5 (and not CXC chemokine receptor 4) from the cell surface and its sustained sequestration in the intracellular compartment without inducing chemotaxis in vitro.

Here we discovered that, in T cells, natural CCR5 antibodies induce a CCR5-negative phenotype with the involvement of β-arrestin2, which leads to the formation of a stable CCR5 signalosome with both β-arrestin2 and ERK1.

We show that macaque-specific CCR5 ZFNs efficiently induce CCR5 disruption at levels of up to 64 % ex vivo, 40 % in vivo early posttransplant, and 3 % to 5 % in long-term repopulating cells over 6 months following HSPC transplant.

In loco cell analysis demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5 deficient host was associated with a more intense influx of T CD8(+) to tumor site, indicating that the presence of CCR5(+/+) B-1 cells in the tumor environment induces the migration of T CD8 CCR5(-/-) cells to the implantation site.

These " helper" NK cells potently attract iDCs in a CCR5-dependent mechanism and induce high DC production of CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5), facilitating the subsequent recruitment of type-1 effector CD8(+) T (Teff) cells.

CCR5 blockade also induces suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) upregulations, and anti-CCR5 antibody fails to suppress expression of phospho-Stat3 (p-Stat3), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and IL-6 in cells transfected with SOCS3 short-interfering RNA (SiRNA).

Investigation of mechanism(s) of the CD56+ T cell action on HIV-1 showed that although CD56+ T SN had little effect on HIV-1 entry coreceptor CCR5 expression, CD56+ T SN induced the expression of CC-chemokines, the ligands for CCR5.

Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.

The virus-like particle (VLP)-CCR5 composition aims to function as either a preventative and/or therapeutic vaccine inducing durable autoantibodies that can block CCR5 and prevent HIV entry or attenuate disease progression.

To investigate the functional role of CCR5 in renal inflammation, we induced a T cell-dependent model of glomerulonephritis (nephrotoxic serum nephritis) in CCR5(-/-) mice.

The fact that CCR5+ regulatory T cells preferentially accumulate in the gravid uterus and that expression of CCR5 on regulatory T cells can be induced by activation lead us to propose that CCR5 is responsible for the accumulation of those regulatory T cells that have been activated by paternal antigens.

The selective CCR5 ligand CC chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta induced the chemotaxis of thymocytes that had been derived from the transgenic mice, but not from littermate mice, suggesting that the human CCR5 expressed in the transgenic mice were functional.

The consecutive CCR5 gene and CCR5 peptide immunizations induced B- and T-cell responses to peptides representing both human and macaque amino acid sequences of the respective CCR5 proteins.

To assess the role of the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, and a ligand for these receptors CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, in this pathogenic process, the reverse passive cutaneous Arthus reaction was induced in mice lacking CCR1, CCR5, or CCL3.

To explore the role of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the inflammatory process of EAN, we induced EAN in CCR5-deficient (CCR5(-/-)) mice with P0 protein peptide 180-199.

Initial studies in mice identified a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal domain of pig-tailed macaque CCR5 fused to streptavidin that, when conjugated at high density to bovine papillomavirus major capsid protein L1 VLPs induced high-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) that bound to a macaque CCR5-expressing cell line in vitro.

In macaques, CCR5 peptide-conjugated VLP preparations induced high-avidity anti-CCR5 IgG autoantibody responses, and all five immunized macaques generated IgG that could block infection of CCR5-tropic simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV(SF162P3) in vitro.

CCR5 ligands induced cell death in these cells, but not in control neuroblastoma cells or in CCR5-expressing fibroblasts.

Our preceding study demonstrated that a nonpeptide synthetic CCR5 antagonist, TAK-779 (N, N-dimethyl-N-[4-[[[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6, 7-dihydro-5H-benzocyclohepten-8-yl]carbon-yl]amino]benzyl]-tetrahydro-2H-pyran4-aminium chloride, inhibits the development of experimentally induced arthritis by modulating the migration of CCR5(+)/CXCR3(+) T cells to joints.

The intraplantar injection of CCL5 (0.5 ng) to naïve mice evoked thermal hyperalgesia prevented by the coadministration of J113863 or the CCR5 antagonist, d-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), demonstrating that CCL5 can induce thermal hyperalgesia in mice through the activation of CCR1 or CCR5.

In order to examine effects of CCR5 on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, we employed CCR5 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice.

To evaluate the role of CCR5 in hypertensive renal and cardiac end-organ damage, we induced hypertension with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in wild-type (WT) and CCR5-deficient mice.

First, we show redundancy between CCR5 ligands not only in chemoattractive properties but also in their ability to induced cosignals via CCR5.

Finally, our results clearly show that although CCR5 ligands induced cosignaling for IL-2 production is directed by CCR5, other proinflammatory properties of these ligands, such as TNF-alpha, IL-17, and IFN-gamma production, are CCR5 independent and therefore likely to be mediated by the other receptors for these ligands.

These suggested that CCR2 and CCR5 mediated hepatotoxicity induced by diclofenac, TNF-α was responsible, at least in part, for it, and the pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 or CCR5 might serve as a novel therapeutic approach for DIC-induced hepatotoxicity.

Upregulation of CCR5 expression on CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells was induced in vitro by CCR5 ligands and other inflammatory factors.

In vitro experiments showed that the upregulation of CCR5 expression on CD11b+Gr1+ immature myeloid cells was induced by CCR5 ligands, IL-6, GM-CSF, and other inflammatory factors.

c-Met signals facilitated T cell recruitment to the heart via the chemokine receptor CCR5 by inducing autocrine CCR5 ligand release.

Homozygosity for CCR5Δ32 confers profound resistance against HIV infection, and heterozygous mutation that induces a decrease in CCR5 surface expression is associated with lower plasma viral load and delayed progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

These data indicate that HIV infection of cells with limiting levels of cell surface CCR5 can be facilitated by gp41 sequences that are not exposed on the envelope ectodomain yet induce allosteric changes in gp120 that facilitate exposure of the CCR5 binding site.

Natural human Abs, recognizing an epitope within the first extramembrane loop of CCR5 (the main HIV coreceptor)  induce a long-lasting internalization (48 h) of the protein, whereas all known CCR5 modulating molecules show a short-term kinetics (60-90 min).

Furthermore, sorting CEM populations expressing low, intermediate, and high densities of CCR5 molecules but constant amount of CD4, we found that the capacity to induce T cell death depends at least in part on the level of CCR5 when low amount of virus was used to infect the CEM cells.

ZFNCCR5Δ32 effectively recognized the CCR5Δ32 region inducing a frameshift of the CCR5 coding region that resulted in the complete absence of CCR5 expression of mRNA and of protein at the cell surface.

We investigated the effect of potent anti-HIV ligands of CCR5 with different pharmacological profiles on arrestin2 cluster formation and found that only the ligands capable of inducing CCR5 internalization induced arrestin2 recruitment and clustering.

Treatment with anti-CCR5 antibody induces changes in the tissue distribution of CCR5+ and CD25+ T cells that may impact on the overall levels of immune activation during HIV and SIV infection.

The presence of CXCR4-using viruses in a subset of newly infected individuals could impact the efficacies of vaccine and microbicide strategies that target CCR5-tropic viruses.

We recently reported that, because these SHIVs exclusively use the CXCR4 coreceptor for cell entry, they target naive CD4(+) T cells for depletion in infected monkeys, whereas SIVs, which use CCR5, not CXCR4, cause the selective loss of memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes in vivo.

Sensitivity to neutralizing antibody was more variable, although infection of CXCR4-expressing targets was generally more sensitive to neutralization by both b12-IgG and 40000000000.0 than infection of CCR5-expressing target cells.

Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of normal lymphocytes increased CXCR4 expression but decreased CCR5 and did not change CCR7 expression.

In PMA-stimulated cells, Tat increased CXCR4 and decreased in CCR5 expression, this was potentiated in cells chronically exposed to Tat.

Chemokine receptors were also modulated in Candida-DCs, which showed increased CCR7/CXCR4 and decreased CCR5 expression.

HIVE cases had increased neuronal CXCR4 and decreased neuronal CCR5 expression as well as increased numbers of hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes and LN3-positive microglia.

Drugs of abuse may promote HIV replication by increasing the expression of CCR5 receptors decreasing the expression of CCR5 receptor ligands, increasing the expression of CXCR4 receptors, increasing the expression of DC-SIGN, and possibly inducing epigenetic changes.

Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes.

HAART increases CCR5 expression further and decreases CXCR4 expression, reversing the switch from CCR5 to CXCR4, which was significant for CD4 + T.

Longer survival in HIV-positive individuals is associated with high serum concentrations of ligands for CCR5 (RANTES [ regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted] and macrophage inflammatory proteins [ MIP] 1 alpha and 1 beta) and CXCR4 (stromal-derived factor [ SDF-1]), and with decreased expression of CCR5 on lymphocytes.

Upregulation of CCR4 and CCR5 expression but no decrease in CXCR4 expression on CD4+ T cells were obtained in peripheral blood from African adults with progression of the disease.

Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs, decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes.

IL-2 activation of CD4+ T cells from both cord and adult bloods caused a substantial increase in CCR5 expression, but moderately decreased CXCR4 expression.

During the secretory phase of the cycle when both oestradiol and progesterone are elevated, CD4 and CCR5 expression decreased whereas CXCR4 expression remained elevated.

It differentially regulates the two major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increasing CXCR4 and decreasing CCR5 expression in primary CD4(+) T-lymphocytes.

MMLV viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an R5 HIV virus specifically infect CCR5-expressing cells, and viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an X4 HIV virus specifically infect CXCR4-expressing cells.

The sequence of V3 determines whether the virus binds to CCR5 and infects predominantly macrophages (R5 virus) or to CXCR4 and infects mostly T-cells (X4 virus).

Selection of resistant viruses and current exposure to a darunavir-based HAART tended to be more frequent in the CXCR4 group compared with the children infected with CCR5-tropic strains (P=0.

Development of CXCR4 inhibitors should greatly improve the treatment options available to patients infected with X4- and/or dual-tropic HIV-1 strains in combination with a CCR5 inhibitor.

Just over a decade after identification of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as coreceptors for HIV, maraviroc (Celsentri), the first CCR5 antagonist, has recently obtained its Marketing Authorization in the United States and Europe, for treatment of treatment-experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.

We used ultradeep sequencing to investigate the evolution of the frequency of CXCR4-using viruses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 22 patients infected with both CCR5 and CXCR4-using viruses treated with the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc for 24 weeks and a stable antiviral therapy.

This desensitization of CXCR4 and CCR5 also attenuated their capacity as the fusion cofactors for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and resulted in a significant inhibition of p24 production by cell lines infected with HIV-1 that use CCR5 or CXCR4 as coreceptors.

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the V3 region in proviral env gene showed that the V3 region in U87-CD4 cells infected with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates was largely different from that in the cells infected with CCR5-tropic isolates, but were highly similar to that in cells infected with dual tropic isolates.

Infection studies with HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses indicated that X4 Env (CXCR4-using) pseudotypes infected megakaryocytic cells, whereas R5 Env (CCR5-using) pseudotypes did not.

Macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains utilize the chemokine receptor CCR5 in conjunction with CD4 to infect cells, while T-cell-tropic (T-tropic) strains generally utilize CXCR4 as a coreceptor.

Furthermore, CCR5 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(R5) infections, and CXCR4 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(X4) infections.

This article focuses on R5X4 HIV-1, the earliest CXCR4-using variants, reviewing the pattern of coreceptor use on primary CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages, the relationship between primary cell coreceptor use and the two principal approaches to coreceptor analysis (genetic prediction and indicator cell phenotyping), and the implications of primary cell coreceptor use by these strains for treatment with a new class of small molecule antagonists that inhibit CCR5-mediated entry.

The activity is confirmed by repeat testing, and identified actives are advanced to secondary screens to determine their effect on transmission of CXCR4-tropic viruses in the presence or absence of CD4 and their ability to inhibit CXCR4- and CCR5-tropic envelope-mediated cell-to-cell fusion.

In particular both pertussis toxin (PTX) and its nontoxic B-oligomeric component (PTX-B) can block the infectious process in vitro at multiple levels, by preventing the entry of CCR5-dependent (R5) HIV strains and by inhibiting both R5 and CXCR4-dependent HIVs at post-entry level(s).

Rapamycin interferes with viral entry of CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV and with basal transcription of the HIV LTR, potently inhibiting replication of R5 HIV but not CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV in primary cells.

Finally, using the air pouch model in mice, we show that the CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist TAK-779 inhibits cell recruitment promoted by the CXCR4 agonist SDF-1 alpha, demonstrating that cross-inhibition by antagonists also occurs in vivo.

In contrast to CXCR4 antagonists and SDF-1, viral monocyte inflammatory protein (vMIP) II inhibited not only anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) but also inhibited anti-CCR5 MAb binding to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and inhibited both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains.

Although both the glutathione S-transferase-CXCR4 N- and C-terminal fusion proteins were associated with the purified CyPA, truncation of the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 robustly inhibited the receptor co-immunoprecipitation with CyPA in intact cells, thereby suggesting a critical role of the receptor C terminus in this interaction.

Moreover, purified GST-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus directly associated with the purified His-tagged beta2-microglobulin (beta2M), and MHC-I heavy chain was co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4 in a beta2M-dependent manner.

These results were confirmed in a human breast cancer xenograft mouse model, suggesting that TRAIL significantly enhanced miR-146a expression and suppressed CXCR4 expression, indicating that TRAIL-induced miR-146a up-regulation is negatively associated with CXCR4 expression.

In this review, we focus on recent advances in the characterization of dysfunctions of the CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling axis in two rare human immunodeficiencies, one associated with a loss of CXCR4 function, the Idiopathic CD4(+) T-cell Lymphocytopenia, and the other with a gain of CXCR4 function, the WHIM syndrome.

Surprisingly, primary envelopes with CXCR4 tropism mediated fusion to immature MDDCs with efficiencies similar to those of primary CCR5-tropic envelopes.

Although CCR3 and CCR5 are known to mediate infection of microglia by HIV-1, recent evidence indicate that CXCR4 also play important roles in HIV-induced neuronal injury, and dual-tropic isolates that use CXCR4 to infect macrophages have recently been reported.

All of the analogs inhibited T cell line-tropic strain HXB-2 (X4) and dual-tropic strain 89.6 (R5X4) HIV infections mediated by CXCR4, but had no effect on macrophage-tropic strain ADA (R5) or 89.6 HIV infections mediated by CCR5.

NSI strains of HIV-1 predominantly use the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a fusion cofactor, whereas fusion of T cell line-adapted SI isolates is mediated by another chemokine receptor, CXCR4.

CCR5-independent fusion was not mediated by CXCR4 and was CD4 dependent, while CCR5-mediated fusion was partly independent of CD4.

CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors that mediate human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, while most simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates use CCR5.

This leads us to hypothesize that early and late CCR5-tropic viruses might be different in the ability to infect CCR5-low or-negative cells.

We ask whether posttreatment development of CCR5 coreceptor virus represents concerted evolution from middisease CXCR4 virus or reemergence of initial infecting CCR5 virus.

The CCR5(+) subset was exclusively infected by CCR5-dependent HIV-1 clones, whereas SI clones were preferentially isolated from the CXCR4(+) subset.

While all SI isolates infected CCR5-/- lymphocytes (and hence do not require CCR5 for viral entry), all NSI isolates, regardless of clade, did not infect CCR5-/- lymphocytes.

Conversely, late isolates were often more CD4-dependent in that productive infection in NP-2/CCR5 cells was in most cases weak and was revealed only after cocultivation of infected NP-2/CCR5 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CD4-independent-LOW).

In experiments with both cell-associated and solubilized CXCR4, we found that although CXCL12γ bound to CXCR4 with a higher affinity than did CXCL12α, CXCL12γ displayed reduced signaling and chemotactic activities.

These properties were caused by the specific carboxyl-terminal region of CXCL12γ, which, by interacting with CXCR4 sulfotyrosines, mediated high-affinity, but nonproductive binding to CXCR4.

Finally, and in contrast to the situation encountered for other previously characterized CXCR4 heteromers, we showed that the CXCR4-specific antagonist AMD3100 did not cross-inhibit chemerin binding in cells co-expressing ChemR23 and CXCR4, demonstrating that cross-regulation by AMD3100 depends on the nature of receptor partners with which CXCR4 is co-expressed.

This may explain, in part, how CXCR4-using viruses are able to bind to and infect a broader range of cell types than CCR5-using viruses, and why CXCR4-using viruses are associated with a more aggressive disease course.

Using the CCRF-CEM T cell line that endogenously expresses CXCR4 we have demonstrated that AMD11070 is an antagonist of SDF-1α ligand binding (IC50 = 12.5 ± 1.3 nM), inhibits SDF-1 mediated calcium flux (IC50 = 9.0 ± 2.0 nM) and SDF-1α mediated activation of the CXCR4 receptor as measured by a Eu-GTP binding assay (IC50 = 39.8 ± 2.5 nM) or a [ (35) S]-GTPγS binding assay (IC50 = 19.0 ± 4.1 nM), and inhibits SDF-1α stimulated chemotaxis (IC50 = 19.0 ± 4.0 nM).

CXCL12, the natural ligand for CXCR4, and the small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 bound the proteoliposomes with affinities close to those associated with the binding of these molecules to cells expressing CXCR4 and CD4.

The health and disease-related biology of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor presents the challenge of finding a small molecule that can bind CXCR4 and block T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cell entry, while preserving the ability of CXCR4 to respond to its native ligand, CXCL12.

Downmodulation of CXCR4 was abolished by mutations that disrupt the constitutively strong AP-2 clathrin adaptor binding element located in the N-terminal region of the Nef molecule, suggesting that Nef accelerates CXCR4 endocytosis via an AP-2-dependent pathway.

CXCR4, the specific receptor for the chemokine SDF-1 alpha that also binds CXCR4-using HIV gp120s, affects survival of different cell types, including neurons.

Gp120s from CXCR4 (X4) and CCR5 (R5) using HIV-1 strains bound more efficiently to non-N-glycosylated than to N-glycosylated CXCR4 proteoliposomes in a CD4-dependent manner.

We analyzed the CXCR4 expression level and the dose-dependent inhibition of CXCR4 expression by AMD3100, by monitoring the binding of an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (clone 12 G5).

The well-characterized CXCR4 antagonists, T22, T14012 (a downsized analog of T-22), and AMD3100, effectively inhibited 12 G5 binding to CXCR4-expressing cells, while HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting CD4 and gp41 as well as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors did not block the binding of 12 G5 to U373-MAGI-CXCR4(CEM) cells.

These gp120 proteins will be useful in dissecting determinants for CXCR4 binding and Env triggering and in evaluating pharmacologic inhibitors of the gp120-CXCR4 interaction.

We studied the binding of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein (gp) to CXCR4 but found that the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains bound nonspecifically to several cell lines lacking human CXCR4 expression.

CXCR4-PMPLs specifically bound the natural ligand, SDF-1alpha, and the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains.

Conformation-dependent anti-CXCR4 antibodies and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 blocked HIV-1 gp120 binding to CXCR4-PMPLs.

We found that the antagonistic action of AMD3100 against CXCR4--as assessed by the inhibitory effects of the compound on stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1) binding to its receptor and on SDF-1-induced intracellular calcium signaling, and by displacement of the CXCR4-specific antibody, clone 12 G5--was greatly reduced by substitution of Asp(171) and/or Asp(262) by neutral asparagine residue(s).

Using FRET between a Texas Red-labeled SDF-1 alpha and an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged CXCR4, we show that binding of SDF-1 alpha to cell surface HSPGs modifies neither the kinetics of occupancy nor activation in real time of CXCR4 by the chemokine.

A CD4-independent version of the X4 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) HXBc2 envelope (Env) protein, termed 8 x, mediates infection of CD4-negative, CXCR4-positive cells binds directly to CXCR4 in the absence of CD4 due to constitutive exposure of a conserved coreceptor binding site in the gp120 subunit, and is more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization.

Gp120 had ten times lower affinity for CXCR4 than CD4, implying that a substantial role for cellular CD4 may be to facilitate binding of the viral envelope to CXCR4.

Binding of gp120 to CXCR4 was neither regulated by guanine nucleotides, nor affected by divalent cations, was temperature independent and bound to a homogenous population of CXCR4, which is characteristic for an antagonist to a G-protein coupled receptor.

Recombinant SU(LAI) protein competed more efficiently with the CXCR4-specific monoclonal antibody 12 G5 for binding to CD4(2D) CXCR4 than for binding to CD4(4D) CXCR4.

Several CXCR4 mutants that were not capable of binding SDF-1 or signaling still supported HIV-1 infection, indicating that the ability of CXCR4 to function as a coreceptor is independent of its ability to signal.

Further deletion of the V1 and V2 loops restored CXCR4 binding activity, but additional removal of the V3 loop eliminated the gp120-CXCR4 interaction, without decreasing the affinity between mutated sgp120 and CD4.

A significant part of CXCR4 was targeted to lysosomes upon binding of the ligands, and recycling of internalized CXCR4 was not efficient.

Notably, our CXCR4 model and docking procedure can be applied to predict new compounds that are either inhibitors of gp120-CXCR4 binding without affecting stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) chemotaxis activity, or inhibitors of SDF-1 alpha-CXCR4 binding resulting in an anti-metastasis effect.

However, escape from inhibition by reagents that block gp120-CD4 binding, CD4-induced CXCR4 binding and 6-helix bundle formation, respectively, indicated large difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins in their CD4-induced rates of engagement with CXCR4.

The AACs and APACs inhibit HIV-1 cell entry by interacting with gp120 at the CD4-binding site, by interacting with CXCR4 at the binding site of the CXCR4 mAb 12 G5, and apparently by interacting with transient structures of the ectodomain of gp41.

A CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent mechanism of viral entry is proposed, by which immature HIV particles from infected lymphocytes might directly bind to CXCR4 on astrocytes and trigger virus--cell fusion during or after the process of viral maturation.

With the use of epitope mapping, mutagenesis, and structural studies, we show that this altered mechanism is characterized by increased exposure of CD4-induced epitopes in gp120 and by a more critical interaction between BR-derived Envs and the CCR5 N-terminus, which was associated with the predicted presence of additional atomic contacts formed at the gp120-CCR5 N-terminus interface.

In this report we show that a variant of HIV-2/NIHz, termed HIV-2/vcp, previously shown to utilize CXCR4 without CD4, is also CD4 independent on rhesus (rh) CCR5, but requires CD4 to fuse with human (hu) CCR5.

Thus, CCR5 expression is required for infection with NSI isolates and the CCR5 usage is independent of viral genotype.

CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.

However, as these drugs do not inhibit HIV variants that use the CXCR4 co-receptor, a pretreatment test is required to determine accurately HIV co-receptor usage (tropism) before initiating CCR5 antagonist-based therapy.

In the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, CCR5-utilizing HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (R5), which typically transmit infection and dominate its early stages, persist in approximately half of the infected individuals (nonswitch virus patients), while in the other half (switch virus patients), viruses using CXCR4 (X4 or R5X4) emerge, leading to rapid disease progression.

Furthermore, GHOST cell infection assays and blocking experiments with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 showed that the later D36 1999 isolate could infect both CCR5(+) and CCR5(-) CXCR4(+) cells efficiently, while infection by the 1995 isolate was nearly completely restricted to CCR5(+) cells.

These results are consistent with previous studies performed in our laboratory where PM were readily infected by CCR5-using HIV strains but could not be productively infected by HIV strains that exclusively use CXCR4 as a co-receptor.

Here we show that two in vitro-established CD4(-)/CCR5(-)/CXCR4(+) human pre-T-cell lines (A3 and A5) can be productively infected by wild-type laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in a CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent fashion.

Since viruses which use CXCR4 exclusively cannot infect macrophages, these data have implications for the relative infection of the T-cell compartment versus the macrophage compartment in vivo and for the development of CCR5-based therapeutics.

Interestingly, some dual-tropic primary SI strains that infected Lestr+ cells failed to infect CCR5+ cells, suggesting that these viruses may use an alternative coreceptor for infection of macrophages.

These results suggest that CXCR4-tropic viruses are present within the quasispecies of patients infected with subtype C virus and that antiretroviral treatment may create an environment for the emergence of CXCR4 tropism.

cmvIL-10 is a secreted viral cytokine that affects CXCR4 signaling in both infected and uninfected cells, while US27 is a component of the virus particle and impacts CXCR4 activity only in infected cells.

Additionally, we show that in HCMV, strain TB40E, infected HUVEC the surface expression of CXCR4 is strongly downregulated, whereas in TB40E-delUS28 infected cells, CXCR4 surface expression is not altered in particular at late time points of infection.

To address causal involvement of CXCR4 in advanced stages of atherosclerosis we reconstituted LDLr(-/-) mice with autologous bone marrow infected with lentivirus encoding SDF-1α antagonist or CXCR4 degrakine, which effects proteasomal degradation of CXCR4.

chagasi antigen LCR1 stimulates IFN-gamma production from T cells of infected BALB/c mice, and immunization with recombinant LCR1 partially protects against L.

Transfected COS7 cells that express a high level of CD4 but a low level of CXCR4 were infected significantly more efficiently by two primary CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates compared to the prototypic laboratory HIV-1 isolate IIIB.

An experiment was carried out to search the expression of CXCR4 retrospectively in FIV (CrFK) infected cat brain tissues using immunohistochemically in the formalin fixed paraffin sections against 12 G5, a mouse monoclonal antibody to CXCR4.

We thus investigate CXCR4 expression in cells infected with this m7NDK CXCR4-dependent HIV-1 mutant.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not efficiently infect and replicate in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, termed " hu-PBL-SCID mice" due to, at least in part, relatively low levels of expression of the CXCR4 coreceptor.

Although CXCR4-tropic viruses are relatively uncommon among untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals except during advanced immunodeficiency, the prevalence of CXCR4-tropic viruses among treated patients with detectable viremia is unknown.

Immunoreactive CCR5 and CCR2B receptors were detected in human blastocysts whereas CXCR4 and CXCR1 were not present.

Strikingly, early CXCR4 signaling of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase detected by SDF-1alpha-induced AKT phosphorylation, was insensitive to RANTES-CCR5 signals.

In contrast to CXCR4, CCR5 was detected at low levels on thymocytes, and CCR5 agonists did not induce calcium flux or chemotaxis in thymocytes.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that infection by CXCR4-tropic viral strains is mediated by the galactosylceramide receptor and the CXCR4 chemokine coreceptor.

These properties were caused by the specific carboxyl-terminal region of CXCL12γ, which, by interacting with CXCR4 sulfotyrosines mediated high-affinity, but nonproductive, binding to CXCR4.

Here, we show that the β-arrestin1·signal-transducing adaptor molecule 1 (STAM1) complex, initially identified to govern lysosomal trafficking of CXCR4, also mediates CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis.

With these methods, we transfected uRPCs to overexpress CXCR4, an important chemokine receptor that mediates uRPC migration to the kidneys after intravenous injection, and demonstrate that CXCR4-uRPCs exhibit enhanced migration compared to mock-transfected cells.

Mechanistic investigations revealed that CXCR4 functionally mediated the SDF-1-stimulated activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in NPC cells with miR-9 downregulation or CXCR4 overexpression.

Recent reports indicate that interactions between the CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) critically mediate the ischemia-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived circulating stem/progenitor cells, but the expression of CXCR4 in cardiac progenitor cells is very low.

Furthermore, these effects were largely abolished by the addition of a CXCR4 inhibitor, indicating that the benefits of hypoxic preconditioning are mediated by the stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCR4 axis, and that therapies targeting this axis may enhance cardiac-progenitor cell-based regenerative therapy.

We show that the interaction between MEDI3185 and CXCR4 is mediated mostly by CDR3H in MEDI3185 and ECL2 in CXCR4.

The [ D-Lys3]-GHRP-6-induced activation of autophagy was found to be abolished by the co-treatment of CXCR4 antagonist, suggesting that the pro-autophagic effects of [ D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 might be mediated through CXCR4.

Abrogation of surface CXCR4 expression impaired SDF-1α directed migration and was mediated through transcriptional down-regulation of PIM1 kinase that in turn phosphorylates CXCR4 and facilitates its surface localization.

Here, we show that CXCR4 antagonist expression from an oncolytic vaccinia virus delivered intravenously to mice with neuroblastoma tumors augmented efficacy of the DC vaccines compared to treatments mediated by a soluble CXCR4 antagonist or oncolysis alone.

We determined that (a) CXCL12/CXCR4 transactivation of EGFR and HER2 is confined to lipid raft membrane microdomains, (b) CXCL12 activation of HER2 and Src is mediated by small GTP proteins in lipid rafts, (c) inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis through plerixafor abrogates the initial establishment of tumor growth without affecting the growth of established bone tumors, and (d) inhibition of EGFR signaling through gefitinib leads to inhibition of established bone tumor growth.

LSEC-expressed CXCR4 mediated CXCL12 transport and blockage of endothelial CXCR4 inhibited CXCL12-dependent CD4(+) T-cell transmigration.

NAMPT inhibits CXCR4 through a NAD/Sirtuin 1-mediated inactivation of HIF1α-driven CXCR4 gene transcription, leading to mobilization of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and enhancing their production of suppressive nitric oxide.

These data indicate that the decreased association of YY1 with c-Myc that is caused by impaired interaction in the c-Myc/Max/Mad network results in increased binding activity of YY1 to the CXCR4 promoter mediating down-regulation of CXCR4 production in HHV-6-infected cells.

The CD4(2D) CXCR4 hybrid mediated infection by HIV-1(LAI) to nearly the same extent as the wild-type molecules, whereas CD4(4D) CXCR4 was less efficient.

The rat CXCR4 cannot mediate infection by HIV-1NDK or by FIVPET (both cell line-adapted strains) because of sequence differences with human CXCR4 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2).

The feline homolog of the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has recently been shown to support cell-cell fusion mediated by CXCR4-dependent strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and strains of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) that have been selected for growth in the Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cell line.

The inhibition of infection was less efficient for CXCR4 lacking the COOH-terminal domain, suggesting at least in part that SDF-1 inhibition of virus infection was mediated through ligand-induced internalization of CXCR4.

Thus, for viruses with a low or medium CCR5-specificity the role of g15 for changing CCR5-usage and sensitivity to neutralization was more significant than for viruses with high infection rates on GHOST-CCR5 cells.

Evolution often involves switch of coreceptor use from CCR5 to CXCR4, but change to more flexible use of CCR5 occurs over time even in patients with maintained CCR5 use.

Studies of the leporid CCR5 gene revealed a very dramatic change unique in mammals at the second extracellular loop of CCR5 resulting from a gene conversion event with the paralogous CCR2.

Thus, the identification of factors and mechanisms that impact the expression of CCR5 in the brain is critical, as changes in CCR5 levels may affect the infection in the brain.

Knockdown or enhancement of CCR5AS expression resulted in a corresponding change in CCR5 expression on CD4+ T cells.

Mutating the CCR5 dimerization interface changed conformation of the CCR5 homodimers and modulated differentially the binding of distinct gp120s.

One possible explanation is that ligand competition at the CCR5 receptor or changed CCR5 availability may shape the outcome of HIV-1 infection.

CXCR4 did not interact with CCR5, the other principal HIV-1 coreceptor, when the two proteins were coexpressed.

specifically, HIV-X4 viruses interact with CXCR4 while HIV-R5 interact with CCR5 co-receptors.

Plasma stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 levels, SDF1-3\A polymorphism, and CXCR4(+) T lymphocytes in relation to resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and its progression were investigated in a study of HIV-positive patients, exposed but uninfected (EU) subjects, and healthy control subjects, all lacking CCR5 Delta 32 homozygosity.

The 239 envelope uses CCR5 for infection of memory CD4(+) T cells, the 316 envelope also uses CCR5 but has enhanced infectivity for primary macrophages, and the 155 T3 envelope uses CXCR4 for infection of both naive and memory CD4(+) T cells.

IgE-FcepsilonRI interactions significantly increased expression of CXCR4 mRNA (approximately 400-to 1800-fold)  enhanced prMC susceptibility to X4 and R5X4 virus (approximately 3000-to 16, 0-fold), but had no significant effect on CD4, CCR3, or CCR5 expression, susceptibility to R5 virus, or degranulation.

As discussed previously, the theoretic concern exists that blocking CCR5 could enhance the emergence of CXCR4-using variants and possibly accelerate disease.

Downmodulation of CCR5 by RANTES was decreased and recycling of CCR5 was accelerated in SF T cells when compared with peripheral blood (PB) T cells.

CCR5 patchiness is, therefore, a signature of liver metastases in our cohort (n = 97 specimens) and relates to globally decreased expression intensity, but does not influence the extent of the response to CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc in patients.

Delayed progression in Caucasian LTNP is also partly associated with heterozygosity of the Δ32 CCR5 allele, probably through decreased expression of CCR5 co-receptor on CD4 T-cells.

There was no difference in CD195 expression between these patients with GD or HD with different severities, but there was a decreased intensity of CD195(+) cells in thyrotoxic patients with GD.

Neutralization of IFN-gamma increased CCR5 expression and decreased CC-chemokine secretion by CD4(+) clones from healthy and IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) individuals, suggesting an IFN-gamma-dependent control of CCR5 expression.

Furthermore, the level of CCR5 expression was directly correlated with the viral load, consistent with the protective mechanism in which a decrease in CCR5 molecules on CD4(+) T cells decreases HIV-1 envelope binding.

In addition, we found enhanced IL-10 production by CCR5-deficient peritoneal macrophages and decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production by CCR5-/- T cells in comparison with CCR5+/+ controls.

Transduction with both siRNAs substantially reduced CCR5 mRNA, which in turn decreased detectable cell membrane CCR5.

DT-13 reduced VEGF and CCR5 mRNAs, and decreased CCR5 protein expression by down-regulating HIF-1α.

CCR5KO mice presented a lower PD severity (lower inflammation and alveolar bone loss) when compared with the WT strain, since the migration of F4/80+, TNF-α+, CD4+, and RANKL+ cells specifically decreased due to the lack of CCR5.

Because patients with frailty demonstrate an overexpression of CCR5, rapamycin (RAPA) and/or maraviroc (MVC), two molecules able to decrease CCR5 expression, were evaluated.

The CCR5-CD4 association, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhanced CCR5 export to the plasma membrane in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas inhibition of endogenous CD4 with small interfering RNAs decreased cell-surface expression of endogenous CCR5.

CCR5 blockade resulted in decreased levels of CCR5+ T cells in blood and, at later timepoints, in lymph nodes.

When CD45RO positive PB T cells were cultured with interleukin 2, blunted responsiveness to RANTES-induced chemotaxis was reproduced as well as spontaneous chemotaxis increased expression of CCR5, and aberrant receptor dynamics, after RANTES stimulation as observed in SF T cells.

Here, we show that by limiting transcription of specific ceramide synthases, CCR5 signaling reduces ceramide levels and thereby increases T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) nanoclustering in antigen-experienced mouse and human CD4+ T cells.

During allograft rejection, expression of CXCR3, but not CCR5 increases on peripheral CD4+ T cells prior to clinical evidence of allograft rejection and remains elevated for more than 2 weeks following transplantation.

Unexpectedly, we found an earlier time to onset and a worsening of GVHD using CCR5(-/-) T cells, which was associated with significant increases in the accumulation of alloreactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in liver and lung.

MS-A showed a significant increase of CD4(+) CD45RA(-) CCR5(+) cells (Th1 cells) through the relapse and remission phases in comparison to HC, while MS-W showed a significant increase of CD4(+) CD45RO(+) CD62L(-) cells (Th1 cells) only at the relapse phase.

chabaudi malaria increased expression of mucosal homing integrin α4β7 on blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, and these α4β7 T cells had significantly increased co-expression of both CCR5 and CD38.

Changes in the cellular composition of HiLNs included decreased proportions of CD4 cells and dendritic cells and increased proportions of CD8, CXCR3, and CCR5 cells.

However, we report that CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion is also associated with a dramatic induction of proliferation among CD4(+) effector memory T (T(EM)) cells and, to a lesser extent, transitional memory T (T(TrM)) cells, raising the question of whether an increased availability of optimal (activated/proliferating), CD4(+)/CCR5(+) SIV " target" cells contributes to this accelerated pathogenesis.

Patients\ CCR5+CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells were further validated and shown to display increases in CD45RA+CCR7- and T-bet+ accompanied by substantial CD107-a, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B levels in response to glioma cells.

In general, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 transiently increased in all mucosal tissues, but those expressing the CCR5, HLA-DR, and CD103 markers exhibited minor changes.

Furthermore, levels of gene-marked CD4(+) T-cells in peripheral blood increased despite systemic infection with either CXCR4- or CCR5- tropic HIV-1 in vivo.

Maraviroc, a CCR5-antagonist, has resulted in larger increases in CD4(+) counts both in naïve and experienced subjects compared to traditional antiretroviral therapy.

We compared CD4 cell count increases associated with chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) inhibitors or other new drugs, using indirect comparison.

CCR5 inhibitors did not increase CD4 cell count to a greater extent than other new drugs.

Primary HIV-1 isolates were weakly neutralized, preincubation with soluble CD4 enhanced neutralization, and engineered isolates with increased dependence on the N terminus of CCR5 or with reduced conformational barriers were neutralized with IC(50) values as low as ∼1 μM.

G312V and A204E Env variants continued to require CCR5 for entry but were up to 50-and 200-fold more sensitive to neutralization by IgG1b12 and soluble CD4 and had a 5-to 50-fold increase in their ability to utilize Ptm CD4 compared to their wild-type counterparts.

The magnitude of macrophage entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses correlated with increased immunoreactivity of CD4-induced gp120 epitopes increased ability to scavenge low levels of cell-surface CCR5, reduced sensitivity to the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, and increased dependence on specific residues in the CCR5 ECL2 region.

M1 polarization was associated with a significant down-regulation of CD4 receptors increased secretion of CCR5-binding chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5), and a & gt.

It is approved for use in ART-experienced patients with CCR5-tropic HIV, and was found to significantly reduce HIV viral load and increase CD4+ cell count when combined with an optimized background ART regimen (OBR).

Although ethanol had a limited effect on the acute plasma viral load, it resulted in reduced circulating memory CD4(+) T cells and increased levels of monocytes expressing the viral coreceptor CCR5.

Notably, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in SF expressed increased levels of inflammation-related trafficking chemokine receptors, such as CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR4.

The total CD4+ T(EM)-cell pool underwent immune activation in controllers, as indicated by increased HLA-DR expression, decreased IL-7Ralpha expression, a bias towards gamma interferon production upon polyclonal stimulation, and increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta secretion associated with chronic CCR5 down-regulation.

In line with an increased susceptibility to HIV infection, PD-1 expression in this CD4 T cell subset was associated with increased activation and expression of the HIV co-receptor, CCR5.

A significantly lower expression of HO-1 in co-infected individuals compared to patients with only HIV-infection having comparable CD4 count correlated well with increased expression of CCR5 and CxCR4 as well as NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, which collectively may contribute to enhanced viral replication and increased cell death, hence faster disease progression in co-infected individuals.

When CD4 signaling was blocked by soluble CD4 or protein kinase inhibitors, p38 activation and Fas-independent cell death were increased among uninfected CD4+ CCR5+ T cells.

These alterations are necessary for the redistribution of CD4-CXCR4/CCR5 to one pole of the cell, a process that increases the probability of HIV-1 Envelope (Env)-CD4/co-receptor interactions and that generates the tension at the plasma membrane necessary to potentiate fusion pore formation, thereby favouring early HIV-1 infection.

The percentage of CD4+ T cells in CVL was not increased after implant placement but the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV co-receptor CCR5 did increase after implant placement (p = 0.02).

Consistent with these observations, CD4-Ig, but none of the CD4bs antibodies tested, substantially increased HIV-1 infection of a CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cell line.

Significantly lower numbers of CD4 T cells in patients with X4 variants (n = 18) compared to patients with non-syncytium inducing/CCR5 using variants (n = 74) were due to increased loss of naive and CD27 memory CD4 T cells.

Furthermore, the cell surface density of CCR5 is increased on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets.

In this study, we observed (i) no signs of simian AIDS, (ii) stable SIV loads, (iii) a slow but progressive decline in CD4(+) T-cell counts (from a mean of 1, 67.0 cells/mm(3) at time point 1 to 764.8 cells/mm(3) at time point 3) and increases in the numbers of animals with CD4(+) T-cell levels below 500 and 200 cells/mm(3) (from 8 to 28 of 78 and from 1 to 4 of 78, respectively), (iv) progressive declines in percentages of naïve CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (from 37.7 to 24.8 % and from 21.0 to 13.0 %, respectively), and (v) stably low levels of activated/proliferating T cells as well as CD4(+) CCR5(+) T cells.

As determined by plasma viral RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proviral DNA, we show improved suppression of productive HIV infection in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NOD (nonobese diabetic)-SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)-il2rg-/- (NSG) mice by combined treatment with cART and CCR5 targeting drugs, compared with cART alone, as well as an increased preservation of human CD4+ T cells (defined as CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ cells) and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios in infected mice.

Analysis of tumor lesions in wild-type (WT) and CCR5KO mice revealed that lack of CCR5 lead to significant reduction in frequency of Tregs and increased of CD4 T cells into the tumors.

When compared with PBMCs, testes were characterized by a lower CD4 T-cell proportion among total T cells, a decrease in the frequency of naive cells, an increase in the frequency of effector-memory T cells and an increase in CCR5 expression in both the HIV+ and HIV- groups.

While the expression of CCR5, CCR6, CD95, CD127, and CD150 has increased in untreated subjects compared with that in HDs, CD45RO has declined in untreated subjects in both DN MAITs and CD8(hi) MAITs.

Compared to Ccr5(+/+) mice, Ccr5(-/-) mice unexpectedly showed increased responses of IFN-γ(+) NK and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, but not CD4(+) T cells.

The expression of chemokine receptors (CD195 and CXCR2) and an adhesion molecule (CD54) increased by CSC treatment, the expression of certain antigen presentation-related proteins (MHC class II, CD40, and CD80) were also enhanced.

Further analysis of donor hearts in the anti-CCR5 antibody plus rapa-treated group demonstrated increased infiltration of CD4(+) CD25(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells, and depletion of CD25(+) cells resulted in acute rejection of allografts in 18 +/- 1 day.

Down-regulation of CCL19, CCR5, CCR7, interferon gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 in the combination treatment was accompanied by increased expression of IL-4, IL-10 and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Tr) cells in spleen.

The presence of CCR5 significantly increased IL-16 binding vs CD4 alone.

CCR5-deficient mice showed increased frequency and absolute number of IL-17-producing CD4+ Th17 cells in lung tissues compared to wild-type mice, whereas the reduced infiltration of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells was observed.

Disruption of CCR5 expression by lentiviral vector-mediated CRISPR/SaCas9 led to increased resistance against HIV-1 infection in human primary CD4+ T cells.

Inoculations resulted in transient increases in CD4(+) T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as a sustained increase in CD4(+) T cells coexpressing CCR5 and α4β7 integrin.

HD-HIV cells showed decreased CD4, but significant increase in the expression of CCR5, CXCR4, Nef-associated factor HCK, and Vpu-associated factor BTRC.

In addition, after removal of CD4(+)/CCR5(+) T cells, the number of CFUs was increased in those patients with a higher number of BM Th1 (CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+)) cells, hypocellularity, or bearing the DR15 allele.

Expanded Ad5 and Ad11 memory CD4 T cells showed an increase in CCR5 expression and higher susceptibility to infection by R5 tropic HIV-1.

Whereas SIV-infected RM show selective numeric preservation of CD4(+) T(SCM), SIV infection induced a complex perturbation of these cells defined by depletion of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T(SCM)  increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and high levels of direct virus infection.

Valacyclovir did not reduce the number of cervical CD4(+) T cells, the number of dendritic cells, or the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and tended to increase the expression of the HIV coreceptor CCR5 and the activation marker CD69.

Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection.

Repeated semen exposures result in lower CCR5 expression in circulating CD4+ T-cells, as well as higher expression of Mx1 (in correlation with IFNε expression) and FoxP3 in the cervicovaginal mucosa, and increased infiltration of CD4+ T-cells.

HIV susceptibility markers CCR5 and CD38 were increased on FGT CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells compared with blood, yet migration to the lymphoid homing chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 was maintained.

Although not required for CD4-dependent fusion, this interaction may serve to increase the binding affinity of Env and CCR5 and/or to facilitate subsequent conformational changes that are required for fusion.

Influenza virus infection of HeLa-CD4 cells resulted in a marked increase in susceptibility to infection by CXCR4-dependent but not CCR5-dependent HIV isolates.

Decreased CCR5 and increased CD4 binding appear to be common features of coreceptor switch intermediates.

Stimulation with heat-killed extracts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis down-modulated cell surface expression of CCR5 on gammadelta T cells in a macrophage-dependent manner, while synthetic phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate and CCR5 ligands directly triggered CCR5 down-modulation on gammadelta T cells.

Stimulation of CCR5 by chemokines triggers internalization of chemokine-bound CCR5 molecules in a process called down-modulation, which contributes to the anti-HIV activity of chemokines.

IL-7 pretreatment of naive T cells also potently up-regulated surface expression of CXCR4 but not CCR5 and mediated the expansion of naive T cells without the acquisition of the primed CD45RO phenotype.

It is a major coreceptor with CD4 glycoprotein mediating cellular entry of CCR5 strains of HIV-1.

Some retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HIV-2 utilize one receptor for high-affinity binding (CD4), and a separate coreceptor to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (CCR5 or CXCR4).

Here, we show that the conserved central region of the second variable loop (V2) of gp120 contains sulfated tyrosines (Tys173 and Tys177) that in the CD4-unbound prefusion state mediate intramolecular interaction between V2 and the conserved base of the third variable loop (V3), functionally mimicking sulfated tyrosines in CCR5 and anti-coreceptor-binding-site antibodies such as 412 d.

Here we show that early-time-point and control Envs were strictly CD4 dependent but that, by day 42 postinfection, plasma virus of CD4(+) T cell-depleted RM was dominated by Envs that mediate efficient infection using RM CCR5 independently of CD4.

Two discoveries in 1996 presented a novel opportunity to redress this issue: 1) the understanding that heptahelical G-protein coupled chemokine receptors on the surface of T cells and macrophages functioned together with CD4 to mediate viral entry, and 2) the observation that CD4 positive T cells from individuals homozygous for the CCR5 delta 32 null allele were resistant to infection by macrophage-tropic strains of the virus in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we show that Fab fragments and complete immunoglobulin molecules of CD4BS antibodies inhibit CD4-independent gp120 binding to CCR5 and cell-cell fusion mediated by CD4-independent HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins.

Treatment of human osteosarcoma cells, expressing CD4 and various chemokine receptors, with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), blocked target membrane glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis and reduced the susceptibility of cells to infection and fusion mediated by envelope glycoproteins from a variety of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates that utilize CXCR4 and/or CCR5.

The major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4 mediate virus entry into CD4+ cells and are therefore a critical component of the HIV-1 life cycle.

CCR5 is also the major coreceptor that mediates HIV infection in combination with CD4.

CD4-dependent variants mediated efficient entry using human CCR5, whereas CD4-independent variants had impaired use of human CCR5.

The human C-C chemokine receptor type-5 (CCR5) is the major transmembrane co-receptor that mediates HIV-1 entry into target CD4+ cells.

In conjunction with studies of SIVsmm, which infects sooty mangabeys, and SIVagmVer, which infects vervet monkeys, our data suggest a unifying model whereby in natural hosts, in which the CCR5 expression level is low, the use of CXCR6 or other coreceptors to mediate infection may target SIV toward distinct cell populations that are able to support high-level viral replication without causing a loss of CD4+ T cell homeostasis and lymphoid tissue damage that lead to AIDS in HIV-1 and SIVmac infections.

By contrast, infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and transfer of infection from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to CD4+ T cells were mediated by CCR5-dependent as well as DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin-dependent pathways.

HIV uptake by CD4(+) T cells was dependent on cellular contacts mediated by the binding of gp120 to CD4 but was independent of the expression of the appropriate HIV coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4.

Our studies suggest that CD4-independent use of CXCR4 can be mediated by different adaptive changes related to the microenvironment of CD4(-) cell.

Differentiated HCT116 cells had increased expression of cell surface C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4) that mediated HIV entry, despite the apparent absence of cell surface CD4.

A CD4-independent version of the X4 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) HXBc2 envelope (Env) protein, termed 8 x mediates infection of CD4-negative, CXCR4-positive cells, binds directly to CXCR4 in the absence of CD4 due to constitutive exposure of a conserved coreceptor binding site in the gp120 subunit, and is more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization.

Infectious CXCR4-tropic HIV-1, but not matched inactivated virions or gp120 mediated CD4(+) T-cell depletion, consistent with mechanisms requiring productive infection.

As use of CXCR4 improved, infection mediated by the mutated envelopes became more resistant to soluble CD4 inhibition and direct binding to CD4 increased.

Binding of the FIV major surface glycoprotein on activated CD4+ T cells was observed through direct interaction with CD134 whereas, on activated CD8+ T cells, the binding was CD134-independent and mediated by CXCR4 and, to a lesser extent, heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins.

HIV fusion and entry into CD4 T cells are mediated by two receptors, CD4 and CXCR4.

Expression of an 85 aa fragment of the GBV-C NS5A phosphoprotein (genotype 2) in a CD4+ T cell line (Jurkat) resulted in inhibition of HIV replication mediated in part by decreased surface expression of the HIV coreceptor CXCR4 and upregulation of SDF-1.
