AML1-ETO represses transcription of RUNX1 target genes by competitively displacing RUNX1 and recruiting corepressors such as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3).

The decreased expression of AML1-ETO chimeric gene was associated with increased expression of LAT1 and RUNX3 genes targets of AML1.

AML1/RUNX1 is a frequent target of chromosome translocations and mutations in myeloid and B-cell leukemias, and upregulation of AML1 is also observed in some cases of T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.

Here, we show that SOX7 inhibits the expression of RUNX1 target genes in HE, while having no effect on RUNX1 expression itself.

Treatment with these inhibitors reduces binding of RUNX1 to target genes, alters the expression of RUNX1 target genes, and impacts cell survival and differentiation.

We further demonstrated that helicase-like transcription factor was a RUNX1 target and transcriptionally repressed by RUNX1-ETO and site-specific DNA methylation through a duplicated RUNX1 binding site in its promoter.

Direct interaction of HIRA and RUNX1 activates the downstream targets of RUNX1 implicated in generation of hematopoietic stem cells.

RUNX1 was identified as a target of miR-302b and their interaction was confirmed by luciferase activity assays, RUNX1 silencing and overexpression of a RUNX1 mutant construct lacking the 3 \ UTR.

RUNX1 was identified as a direct target of miR-302b, and knockdown of RUNX1 inhibited cell growth in a manner similar to miR-302b overexpression, whereas introduction of a 3 \ UTR mutant of RUNX1 reversed the suppressive effect of miR-302b.

Finally, we discuss how aberrant PTMs of RUNX1 might contribute to tumorigenesis and also strategies to develop anticancer therapies targeting RUNX1 PTMs.
